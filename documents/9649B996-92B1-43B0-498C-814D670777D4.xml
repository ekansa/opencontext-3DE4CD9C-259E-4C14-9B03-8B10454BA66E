      <arch:string>At the end of excavation season, trench supervisors were expected to write a concise summary of the full season's activities in each trench. This summary was the first step in building the interpretation and archaeological narrative of each trench.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Trench Summary 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sibel Torpil / Eser Karaca&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;    This trench is located on the lower mound at Kenan Tepe That dates from the Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age. This was the third season for the trench to be excavanted. It is a 10x10 trench. To the south side of F7, F9 is located and F14 is to the west of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;    Till today the area was characterized by lot of ovens, ash and was significantly locking any material remains or structuras that implied a domestic use. This is the largest trench of the area, and it gives us the horizontal picture of the lover mound. We started to excavate trench F7 on July 7, 2004. The last locus number that this trench had was L7101; and it has been given to pot sherd which found in the west baulk of the trench . Having this knowledge helped us at giving correct locia numbers. The first locus that we opened was L7102. L7102 was consisting the whole trench. This was a silty locus. The aim of this locus was to get the trench to be cleaned; in other words the aim was to remove dirt. The process of removing dirt lasted in tewelve days. When we started to excavate F7, the pit L7094 was stil siting in the north-east portion of the trench. We gave a new locus number to the pit . The locus number of the pit is L7103, and it is still in the trench. The pit was only articulated by us. Through articulating we wanted to get a stratigraphycall guiede for us, by this way we might got an idea of what was approaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;    Nontheles; we also took on the human skeleton. The human skeleton was located at the south-east portion of the trench. It was unearthed in the season of 2002. The locus number that the human skeleton was removed from it`s place on July 12, 2004. The starting elevation of the human skeleton was 572.04 m and the closin elevation was 569.17m. The human skeleton was placed in a hocker position, and was facing the east. Nothing has been found in its context that could be used for dating like beads and potsherds. Removing the human burial took us a day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="body_text_indent" awml:style="Body Text Indent" dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.2500in"&gt;&lt;span&gt; The entire trench was covered with fill layers. Most of these fill layers demonstrated Late Chalcholithic and Early Bronze Age ceramics. On the other hand the potsherds coming up from L7108 demonstratede that the trench was in the Transitional period between the Late Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age. At this locus (L7108) a blade has been found and it has been labelled as a small find. The KT number of the blade is 11 and the elevation was 569. 24m. In addition to this blade lot of animal bones have been found. These animal bones made us think that the inhabitants of this area might have used this spot as a butchering area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.2500in"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to these a cylinder seal has been found in L7109. This seal has been labelled as a small find too. It seems to have tree impressions on. The KT number of the seal is 6 and the elevation was 569. 21m. The other small find that the trench yield was a metal needle. It came from L7117; which is a fill locus. The KT number of the needle is 7, and the elevation was 569. 14m. The needle was at the top of a pile of broken potsherds which were demonstrating characteristic features of the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age. And just in the middle of this pile we found a small bowl and we labelled it as a small find too. The KT number of the bowl is 9, and the elevation was 569. 09m. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.2500in"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Till to the end ofr the season we have carried out our excavation on thirty- five locia. The last two locial; L7136 and L7137 are two small pits which are not excavated yet. These two pits need to be investigated during the field season of 2005. But, I think that L7136 is demonstrating an oven. The point what makes me think that it might be an oven is the few brick like features that are sitting on the edge of it. To find out what that is it has to be excavated, so it is not clear yet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.2500in"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most exiting feature that the trench yield this season was the Late Chalcolithic house at the North west portion of the trench. The feature that made us think that it was an architectural remain was the mud-brick wall L7121 and it was the running from the north to the south and than it was making a corner to the east and than it was running to the north again. The interior side of L7121 was L7118 it was totally covered with ash. After removing the wall L7121 we were able to observe that the mud- brick wall was sitting on an ashy layer. Besides these all we have also found a collapsed oven and we excavted it. The locus number of the oven was L7124. We tried to find out if the oven L7124 had a connection with the Late Chalcolithic house. But we found out that that the house and the oven do not have a connection in between. The only common feature that they are sharing is that both the wall L7121 and the oven L7124 were sittin on an ashy layer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class="body_text_indent_2" awml:style="Body Text Indent 2" dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.2479in"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However; the entire trrench is demonstrating ashy spots and ashy layers, just like the neighbouring trenches in area F.This makes us think that the lower mound of Kenan Tepe was totally burned down. All in all it is visible that F7 is getting into the Late Chalcolithic period with yielding domestic features. But this needs to be investigated next season. The first thing that should be carried out during the filed season of 2005 should be excavating the pits L7136 and L7137 and removing the fill of L7126. The reason to start with L7126 is because of the cobbles that showeed up in the south east portion of the trench which might lead the trench to have a surface or a floor. In addition to these all the south west corner of, which is a part of L7128 should be coming up with a small pit which was not quiet clear this seaason. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
