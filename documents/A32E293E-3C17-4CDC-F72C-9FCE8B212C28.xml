      <arch:string>At the end of each week, trench supervisors were expected to write a concise summary of the previous week’s activities.  The purpose of this weekly summary was to review the week’s notes, check for completeness, identify any mistakes or missing information, and to begin building interpretations.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench G6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 21, 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Trench Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	We began this trench in order to reach the jar burial that was found during the 2000 field season in sounding G4. The trench was laid out as a 5x5 but we initially dug a 4x1 meter test strip running north to south. The boundaries of the trench encompassed the area of G4. Our plan was to push this area down in a rapid but careful fashion, using the section of the sounding as our guide, until we reached the surface we assumed the burial was dug into. There was hard mudbrick in the section of G4 that was to be our guide when we knew we were getting close to the level of the jar burial. We were unable to reach this goal due to the ups and downs of the field season, but we were able to exhume a different burial and get the trench in prime position for removal of the jar burial next season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the trench was dug as a 1x4 it is important to note that locus 1 was not closed until the end of the season. Locus 1 was topsoil. We assumed we would expand the trench once we hit the good context of the burial. As a result of this assumption we left locus 1 open so when we removed the topsoil in the entire 5x5 it would all have the same locus. We thought that having 3 or 4 loci all of topsoil with different locus numbers, especially loci with higher numbers, which would tend to indicate older contexts and lower elevations, would be unnecessarily confusing. (Much as that sentence just was.) Unfortunately we were not able to expand and thus locus 1 was left in a limbo state. This is indicated in the database by the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast elevations being the same as the opening elevations whereas the center elevations are the elevation at which Locus 2 was opened. Locus 1 was very rich in pottery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 2 was opened below when the soil changed from light brown to a darker brown and the texture shifted from the loamy topsoil into a more clayey composition. This was at a fairly high elevation, much higher than I expected the topsoil to end. It is sub-topsoil and despite its difference in soil texture from the topsoil is still not a good context. The soil exhibited some of the white pebble areas that we associate with the virgin soil and redeposited virgin soil of the area. This locus went rather deep and stopped when three new areas appeared. There was a core in with the lithics, but other than that no exceptional or unusual finds. There was a lot of pottery collected, however.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 3 was the northern end of the 1x4 meter strip below Locus 2. This was an area of mudbrick wash/slump that we originally took to be a wall. The top portion was chunky and looked like the top of an eroded wall, but upon sectioning and checking for brick lines this was not the case. A few isolated bricks could be identified, but they were not a wall or any type of formal structure. This may indicate the presence of a wall that is slumping in an unexcavated portion of the trench. This locus was closed when we reached Locus 6 the final locus excavated this season. The soil changed to a medium packed silt loam. Most likely it changed at a slightly higher excavation. All the loci opened under Locus 2 stopped at about the same elevations. This change was made on a day when several excavators were helping run the trench so their opening elevations may be slightly incorrect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 4 was an ashy pit that was located in the central portion of the 1x4 meter strip. It cut the mudbrick slump, Locus 3, which is to its north. It also cut the fill located to the south, which is Locus 5. It was a very shallow pit. It too ended at the silt loam of Locus 6. Again no fantastic finds, but we did recover some shell from the area, which we had not found any of up until that time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 5 was an area of soft packed silt loam. It contained some of the white pebbles found in the virgin soil and also found in Locus 2, which is above this locus. Due to the texture change I felt comfortable in opening a new locus. This fill ended at Locus 6, which was a harder packed silt loam. It was felt that this change in soil density warranted the change to the new locus. An obsidian flake was found in this locus.	 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 6 spanned the entire 1x4 meter area of the trench. It was a medium packed silt loam that broke down into very fine particles. A sun disk small find was located in this locus, KT 7, in the southern end. It was not quite in the burial pit of Locus 8, but it was only 3 cm above the elevation of the burial. While excavating the southern end of Locus 6 we happened upon some large bones that one of the workmen broke. Upon examining that bone it turned out to be a distal humerus. Unfortunately in the meantime pieces of human bone were probably mixed into the animal bone bag. I opened a new bag immediately for the piece of human bone and attempted to locate some human fragments in the animal bone bag, but there may be mixed pieces of both human and animal in both bags. As we discovered with sweeping and cleaning there was other human bone present in the ground, i.e. a rather robust ulna, we knew we had a burial, Locus 8. Since the burial was located in the center of the trench we realized we would have to make a cut down on both the east and the west to ensure that if it was a lying out fully and not flexed we could remove its full extent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 7 was the cut in the west. We took out a 1.5m by 1.10 m section. The 1.5 meters took us to the west baulk. There were no lithics found in this cut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 9 was the cut in the east. It too extended 1.5m, taking us to the east baulk. It was only .77m wide. We had to leave a baulk between the cut and the G4 sounding, which is located inside the boundaries of the trench. No lithics were found in this cut either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 8 was the burial. It was a very robust male. He was placed in a flexed position head to the east and feet to the west. His face was turned to the south. He was in a poor state of preservation. Several different persons including myself and two members specifically from our bone team excavated him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5000in"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Loci 10, 11, and 12 were all unexcavated. Locus 10 was the area below the cut of Locus7, Locus 11 is the area below the burial pit and Locus 12 is the area below the cut of Locus 9.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p/&gt;
