   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench Summary 2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 20, 2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench B4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench B4 is a 10 x 10m trench located close to the southern edge of the tepe on a steep slope. It is east of Area C and west of Area A, adjacent to trench A5. Trench B1, excavated last year makes up the south western quadrant of the trench. There is a 1 meter baulk between Trench A5 and this trench and there is a .5m baulk and a .30m baulk between the North and East baulk (respectively) of Trench B1. We opened this trench to reach some more of the contexts we found in trench B1 last year, and because area B had predominately Iron Age pottery, we wanted a better understanding of the Iron Age settlement that exists on the top of the mound. One particular surface excavated in B1 last year was interesting to us because it was a good context for Iron Age pottery and it sealed a new assemblage of pottery that we now think is from the second millennium. We want to capture this transition again in the new trench. Trench B1 was left at around 2m deep last year and the rest of B4 was a newly opened trench. Opening elevations were NW 97.79, NE 98.90, SW 97.88, and SE 99.02. We closed with the following elevations: NW 97.55, NE 98.31, SW 97.35, SE 98.50. So we dug down a little less than a meter in most of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began by clearing topsoil in L4000. Since there is a large slope on the mound we cleaned a lot of topsoil for over a week in various parts of the trench. On the first day we found a pot smash in the NW quadrant of the trench and changed locus to 4001 as the top soil above the potsmash and called the pot smash itself L4002. The pottery rims indicate that L4002 was mostly Iron Age pottery. The next day, further east we found a cobble wall with two courses running N to S, which eventually became L4014 but the fill around and above the wall was excavated as L4000. We think that the lower course of the wall 4014, which was partially excavated, is related to the cobble surface we found later in L4027. A piece of the lower course of this wall is still in situ, it is about 1m long and it continues into the south baulk (actually the North baulk of trench B1). We found another set of stones which later became L4008, at the NE corner of the trench that were a single row running N to S at a higher level than the first cobble wall 4014 we found in the west half of the trench. We called fill above the L4008 cobbles L4003 and continued to look for more of the cobbles in both L4003 and L4004. Thus begins the search for the cobbled areas in the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In L4000 adjacent to the North baulk in the eastern half of the trench we found more stones that eventually joined with the stones found in L4003. Those first stones found in L4003 turned out to be the eastern border of a large concentration of stone cobbles beginning in the north baulk and crossing southwards. We called this cobble area L4008 and the final size of the area was about 4 x 4m of large cobbles ranging from .05m to .50m flagstones scattered in no particular pattern, yet the cobbles near the north baulk looked more organized than the rest indicating a possible wall beneath them. In this north baulk section of L4008, there was an area devoid of stones. I thought it was a pit but it turned out to be hard packed silt above another course of stones. This area was our window into what lay below the stone collapse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few days after discovering the beginnings of the cobble area of L4008 we started to find cobbles in the Southern part of the trench along with some flat lying pottery sherds. When we saw that this could be a new feature we changed locus from topsoil (4000) to L4004. With L4004 we looked for more pottery and cobbles and hoped to find a link between L4008 and this new set of features. We never did connect the two entities. While digging in L4004 we found a small find which was a ceramic animal head (KT 4066). When we finally found the extent of this new cobble and pottery area we changed locus to L4018 which is the feature itself. The cobbles in L4018 have lots of pottery sherds whereas there are very few in L4008. L4018 is also at a lower elevation than L4008 and does not have any associated surfaces with it.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another feature uncovered in this half of the trench is in L4019. This is a wall curved into the eastern baulk of the trench with one row and one course. The stones are organized at the north end but are less so at the south end. There were two small finds, one stone cut in half with a recessed hole in the middle and a piece of basalt grindstone. The fill above this locus is L4003. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last interesting feature in East half of the trench is L4013 and L4017, an oven. We first uncovered the destroyed oven in L4009 and immediately assigned locus 4013 as the fill inside the oven once the fill above the oven was cleared. While excavating the oven fill we found large bits of fired clay and plaster with some charcoal bits that were too small to sample. We excavated inside of the oven first to find the bottom. We dug for a while past a few sets of flat lying pot sherds, past the clay and plaster chunks and found a soft ashy soil that seemed to still be part of the oven. Unfortunately none of these levels in the oven were given separate loci. Then it occurred to us that almost .5m is a little too deep to still be part of an oven. We looked at the adjacent eastern baulk of former trench B1 and saw an ashy layer continuing under the level of where the oven should have stopped. The good news is that I have dug a nice sounding in the middle of my trench, the bad news is that I have mixed the oven fill with the fill below it, but since I was not sure which fill was indeed part of the oven, I did not assign a new locus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The oven wall, L4017 is an interesting feature as well. We troweled back as much of the caked fill away from the wall in L4017 as we could and found large potsherds lying up against the oven wall and underneath it. We could see the oven wall preserved inside the oven but the outside of it had collapsed. Because the soil was still ashy we continued to dig past the level of the bottom of the preserved wall as L4013. We thought that the sherds up against the oven wall and flat beneath it indicated that a surface existed next t o the oven. We opened an arbitrary area around the oven, L4016 to focus excavation on the fill around the oven wall, looking for surfaces. We found nothing conclusive, even after continuing into L4009 looking for more potsherds or a surface. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fill loci above and around the features described above have had border disputes all season. L4003 is fill above the large cobble surface in L4008 and the fill east of that surface and north of L4004. I dug extensively in this locus looking for surfaces to associate with the features but found nothing. Early in the dig I found an unusual circular feature with cobbles and pottery which I removed as locus 4011 under L4003 and L4004 (depending upon which day it was). The pottery turned out to be thick fired clay bricks and conglomerate rock, this would have indicated a firing area but that there were no burned or scorched areas, nor was it possible to take carbon samples. L4003 and L4004 were constantly mixing at their south and north border. One day I would look for cobbles and stones continuing south in L4003, the other I would find more cobbles and pottery in L4004 and extend the locus north into previous L4003 territory. Another segment of fill is L4010 which is all of the fill east of the small cobble surface L4018 and then later extended below L4003 as the fill east of the L4019 curved wall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of the fill (L4003, L4004, L4006, L4007, L4009, L4010, L4020) west of the cobble surfaces (L4008, L4018, L4019) on the eastern half of the trench has had many transformations as well. First we found a large area about 1.5m wide and 3.5 long of mudbrick collapse, or an area of hard packed silt loam that felt like mudbrick but had no visible lines. Locus 4000 is above the mudbrick collapse and L4006 is the mudbrick collapse area. We kept this area open until we finished articulating the cobble area in L4008 and then began excavating in the west fill. We removed L4006 and established L4007 as all of the fill west of the cobble surface in the eastern half of the trench. About this time we found the cobble area in L4004/L4018 and called the fill west of that area L4009. We peeled back L4009 looking for the extent of the cobble surface and found that we were continuing into L4007 and the soil was the same so we changed the entire area to L4009 which it still remains today. When all of the features were given new names I renamed the fill loci east of the features as one L4020. This locus is fill east of L4008, north of L4018 and west of L4019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now on to the removal of the features described above, here is where it gets complicated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I assigned a removal locus 4021 to the feature L4008. We found seven small finds in the area while picking up stones. One large round cobble, one rock with a hole through it, one flat rock with a hole in the middle and the rest were basalt grindstones. When we removed stones from the northern part of the locus I made sure that the stones that we saw previously in the thing we thought was a pit remained in situ along with all of the other stones in situ. We removed all of the stones and found that there was a second course of stones at the North baulk area but the rest of the stones were not part of this course. When deciding which stones were first course and which were second, I was not entirely sure, so I kept some from each course if it looked like they might be associated. I found another blank spot of soil in this course but it was more pronounced. Because I felt this locus was too mixed with the above course of stones I decided to further remove the stones in L4021 and what luck! I find a third course of stones. The blank area between the sets of stones was even more pronounced this time and one set of stones curves into the north baulk while the other continues down the slope of the tepe and is 4 rows wide we called this whole entity L4027.  We found some flat lying sherds, animal bones and roots in the area but no surface. We dug a sounding in adjacent L4009 to see if the rocks continued and they appeared to dive down another .15m to the south which may indicate that we have a corner of a wall between L4021 and 4009. We also dug at the western border of L4021 where we had cleaned out a huge animal hole before excavating. We came down .10m and found a hard soil area that could have been the surface associated with the stones but we found no cultural debris. We continued further in this sounding about .05m and found a pot sherd and some very ashy soil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My biggest problem this year was how to name this feature of three courses and two walls separated by fill. The solution we came up with was that we called all three courses of the stones L4027. This locus includes the northern area of stones that looked like a wall in L4008 (not the entire cobble area), the second course removed with removal locus 4021 and the current course which is level three which remains in situ. The whole structure has been given its own feature locus and description in L4027. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We removed the wall in L4019 and found soft ashy soil L4025 underneath, which is similar to the soil inside the oven. We also removed L4018 and did not find anything immediately beneath but we removed three basalt grindstones from the locus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we removed the oven wall feature L4017 as removal locus L4022. We bagged the pottery sherds and oven wall fragments separately in L4022. After the removal of the oven wall in L4022 we found flat lying pottery sherds lying beneath the oven wall and assigned L4024 to this new discovery. We called this locus the removal and discovery of the pottery sherd foundation of the oven wall. Just to clarify, we removed the oven wall in three loci, L4017 is the oven wall feature and the articulation of that feature before removal, L4022 is the removal locus for the oven wall and L4024 is the pottery foundation found directly beneath the oven wall after removal of L4022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After most of the features were removed we started to big pick the soil beneath as L4020. Under L4019 and part of L4010 was an ashy layer of loose brownish grayish soil that was riddled with animal burrows; by the end of the dig day, the trench looked like a golf course. We excavated this area of ashy soil and animal burrows as L4025 which started as a small area then expanded into L4020 where it was mixed a little at the south border between L4020 and L4025. As I said before, L4020 became all of the fill east of L4021/L4027, and the fill north of L4010 and L4018.  We big picked down .15m in L4025 to get past the animal holes and found more underneath. Our original conclusion about this area was that it was a pit, but it looks like the soil in this ashy area is almost the same as the soil inside the oven in L4013. It is possible that there is an entire layer of ashy soil just beneath the current elevation, that continues into the baulk of trench B1. In L4020 we chopped down another .15m or so and found some mudbrick clumps but nothing organized looking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While this excavation was going on in the eastern half of the trench I decided to open a little sounding area to find out if we would be able to excavate the surface that was visible in trench B1 last year. We opened L4012 as a 1 x 2m sounding in the SW baulk. We went down about .15m and found two huge flagstones continuing into the baulk and surrounded by a greenish grayish ashy layer. When we looked at the section of this baulk we found that there might be a pit in this area, which would explain the soil texture and color. We extended L4012 to the entire west half of the trench with the intention of digging the whole area to the level of those flagstones. We didn't make it that far but we did find some interesting spots. At the north baulk we found a basalt grind stone small find.  I took a carbon sample while scraping in an area of very hard silt loam of L4012 adjacent to the remnant of wall L4014, close to where I got the sample we found a potsmash area with a few cobbles in it. We picked up this last set of pottery as its own KT because if we had left it in situ it would be destroyed by next year. I did not change locus for this set of pottery because I found no surface or other things associated with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt; We cut back two baulks from trench B1 this year in order to get a better idea of what would be happening in this new trench. We chopped .23m of the north baulk, L4005 and bagged all of the artifacts. We found a nice large and flat basalt grindstone in the section. We also chopped .10m off the east baulk of B1 in Locus 4015 and bagged the artifacts as well. The sections in the adjacent trench have been a guide for us as to where we should focus our excavating efforts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My understanding of this trench is murky to say the least. The huge rock installations that we found this year are slightly confusing. The large cobbles found in the North east quadrant of the trench, L4008, are probably collapse from a large wall structure, which we can see the foundations of coming up in the second and third courses of stone. The wall must have been pretty tall and the rocks scattered next to the first course must have tumbled off the wall south and scattered over the area. The cobbles along the north baulk seem to continue eastward which would indicate that they link to the stone walls found in Trench A5 directly adjacent to the NE corner of this trench. Note that trench A5 and its extensions A1, A3-A4 are all part of a supposed cemetery at the top of the tepe, where we found a cyst tomb and over twenty burials. The third course of stones for this structure is what seems to relate to most of the features in the trench. We found that the stones of this course continue into L4009 and they dive downward, so the wall is heading south and there is a corner at the junction of L4027 and L4009. The wall in L4014 found in the west half of the trench is related as well when you see that the wall dives south it runs parallel to the last course of the two course wall we found in the first week of digging. The third course of the massive structure also relates to the oven because the base of the oven is only a few centimeters below the elevation of the third course. The curved cobble wall, L4019, found a meter east from L4008 is at about the same elevation as the top of the rock collapse; I'm not sure how they could be linked. Originally, when we found the ashy soil L4025 below the curved wall L4019 we thought we had a rock lined pit, but now that its clear that the ashy soil extends over a large area and that can not possibly be true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second cobble feature in the south of the trench is unusual too. I could find no way of linking this feature with L4008 by a surface or even additional cobbles. I believe this area is a cobble surface that has eroded down the tepe judging by the slope it was on and the huge amounts of pottery that we found when excavating it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is most interesting to note that all of these features were within .5m of the opening topsoil of the trench. I have been told that all of the pottery found in these features is Iron Age, so the fact that these structures are so close to the surface bodes well for future trenches in the area. There could be a large Iron Age settlement with a lot of stone architecture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We did not dig enough of the fill in the Western half of the trench to make any judgments on it but there is a surface only a few more centimeters below the present level in the SW corner of the trench that we see in section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To close out my trench, my last locus number was L4027 and my last is KT # 4330.  We did not draw any baulks this year because it was only until recently that we hit anything other than topsoil. The only baulk in trench B1 drawn last year was the North baulk. It is a good idea to draw the East baulk as well because the stratigraphy for the trench is nicely laid out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Loose ends in my trench are basically the fill beneath all of the features we took out. We did not find the extent of the ashy soil, nor did we prove or disprove that the area was a pit or not. We did not clean or fully excavate the third course of stones in L4027 so those should be further investigated. In the western half of the trench, L4012, we did not get to the surface but we may have a pit in the SW corner where the large flagstones were found because we can see that the soil has turned loose and is a greenish grayish brown. The rest of this locus is unclear. Also watch for a mud brick wall that may be coming up in the NE fill of the trench in L4020, we found some small chunks but nothing conclusive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If another large trench is opened north of this trench, the stone architecture found this year might be better explained and we may find contexts to help date these stone structures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
