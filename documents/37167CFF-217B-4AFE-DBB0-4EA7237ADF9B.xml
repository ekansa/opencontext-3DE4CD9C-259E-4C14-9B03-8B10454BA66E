   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;J. Nijhowne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Trench F21 is located on the southern edge of the tepe approximately half way between the upper tell and the river. It lies approximately 60 cm east of F6. F21 expanded south as we excavated. Its final dimensions were 2.64 m x 4.25 m. We laid out this trench for the sole purpose of coming down on the surface seen in the east baulk of F6. This surface is composed of rocks and gravel but was cut through when the original test trench F6 was expanded. Our intention was to big pick our way through the matrix to within 50 cm or so of the surface and then start excavating. For this reason, opening elevations were not taken. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excavation Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	After the workman opened the trench using large picks, they came across a wall comprised of conglomerate stones. We changed our original plans and decided to level the trench and start recording our finds. I designated the wall locus 1. Its highest point is 570.46 m. The matrix around the wall contained no discernible features so it became locus 2, highest point 570.40. Because of the lack of features, we chose to excavate in arbitrary levels of 25 cm each. Before beginning the first large pick pass for locus 2, we removed what we thought was going to be a well-preserved base sherd at the southern end of the trench. It turned out to be a whole pot with another whole pot inside, KT3 (larger pot) and KT4 (smaller pot). We excavated locus 2 and 3 with large picks. Both abutted the wall locus 1. In locus 3 we found half a fish net weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	As we completed locus 3, we found a surface, locus 4, which lay just east of the wall locus 1. At this point, we could not determine whether the surface and the wall were associated or not. For that reason, we decided to disassemble the wall. It appeared that the wall ended somewhere above the floor because the lowest stones had been pedestaled to keep them in place. We removed the matrix between the upper stones with trowels and the first course of stones. More stones lay underneath. These had been hidden by the matrix left as pedestals. Apparently the pedestaled stones were ones that had slipped off the wall. The stones continued down to within 15 cm of the floor. There we found a base of very compact earth on the west side of the wall and a mix of small stones and gravel on the east side. We leveled this but the stones and gravel layer went deeper than the floor. We stopped, removed the floor with small picks and trowels, and then finished locus 1. The small stones ended 3 cm below the floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	With wall locus 1 and the floor locus 4 removed, we again had a featureless trench which became locus 5. We did two big pick passes to complete the arbitrary level. In this locus we found a broken spindle whorl, part of grinding stone and part of a fish net weight. When we finished, we discovered an area of very soft sand in the center of the trench. We defined the boundaries of this pit locus 6 with trowels. We took a soil sample KT 5 from the top and screened 1 bucket of matrix in the big screen to see if we were missing anything. We werenâ€™t. Soon we came across large pieces of pottery that obviously belonged to the same pot. We set these aside to be bagged separately. The sherds are KT6 and KT7 as we collected them over two days. Towards the bottom, we came across pieces of bones. As we suspected this might be a burial, we were on the look out for them. We started putting the matrix through fine meshed screens. As a result, we collected a quantity of human bone including many teeth. They appear to be the bones of a young child. Right at the bottom of the pit, a flat piece of bone lay directly on a large sherd. We collected an additional soil sample KT10 as it appeared ashy at the bottom of the pit but we screened it first to remove any human bone. There were no artifacts associated with the burial and we excavated the pit as a single unit. The top of the pit was at an elevation of 569.60 and the bottom 569.04. The bottom was cut into virgin soil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	No apparent surface or floor was visible in the pit profile. Since the whole raison dâ€™etre for this trench was to excavate the floor with the aim of taking a HAP sample, I decided to lay out a 1x1 m square in F21 that had the best chance of having a preserved surface. To do this, I had two workmen stand in F6 next to its eastern baulk at the north and south ends of the surface in profile that was most easily seen. I laid out the 1x1 against F21â€™s western baulk starting at 2 meters south of the north baulk and ending 3 meters south of the north baulk. I named the 1x1 locus 8 and the remainder of the trench locus 7. Again, these are arbitrary loci. In locus 8, I started at 569.65 and ended at 569.48. According to the elevations, we should have been on top of the surface but couldnâ€™t find anything definite. We decided to take the entire trench down to 569.48 which we did with a big pick pass. For this reason, I combined locus 7 and locus 8 on the locus sheets. We reset the 1x1 in its original spot and tried again. This is locus 9. The intention was to find a surface we could follow beyond the 1x1. We took locus 9 down to 569.41 which means we should have been through the floor. We did find stones and some gravel but absolutely nothing appeared that remotely made a convincing living surface. We decided to expand locus 9 out the way we had with locus 8. As the workman small picked their way north, they hit virgin soil so we stopped. We set the original 1x1 up again and named it locus 10. We took it down to virgin soil at 569.31. No surface was found so we abandoned the trench. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The conglomerate wall locus 1 and the floor locus 4 are definitely associated. The floor did not continue under the wall since the rock/gravel foundation went below the level of the floor. The child pot burial locus 6 appears to be earlier than the wall and floor since the top of the pit lies approximately 20 cm below the floor.. The top of the pit was so soft, it is unlikely that we cut through it without noticing. But the whole purpose of the trench was to come down on the surface seen in the east profile of F6. In F6, the surface appeared substantial but when we came down on top of it, no continuous surface of any kind was apparent. Yes, we did find rocks and gravel so I am quite sure the layer does extend into F21 from F6 and does not end in the baulk. But I am not convinced that it is a cultural layer. We did not find flattened sherds or bones that could have been stomped into a living surface. It lies directly on virgin soil and could be the result of natural geological processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
