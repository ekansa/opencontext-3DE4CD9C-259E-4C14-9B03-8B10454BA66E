   &lt;h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Trench Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;8/11/02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyText" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;1.0 General Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 2002 season in A4 focused primarily on the removal of burials identified in the 2001 test trenches. A4 is an 8m by 8m area cross cut by two, two meter wide trenches. One extension trench is 8m long and runs north to south. The other extension is a smaller, 4m long trench branching off the main extension and running east to west. These two trenches excavated an average of 30 to 50cm below ground surface and had revealed a total of 8 potential burials by the end of the 2001 field season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyText" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;2.0 The Burials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work in 2002 began by removing unexcavated material from the 4 by 4m block in the northeast quadrant of A4 and the 2 by 4m block in the southeast quadrant down to a level near the existing trench floors. 5 additional burials were revealed in the process. With the exception of the burials themselves, all sediments were removed using picks and shovels and were unscreened. Burials were exhumed using small tools and screened through 2mm hand sieves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;8 burials were removed from the A4 trench this year. Those newly identified include a collection of hand bones from 4023 and infants in 4024, 4025, and 4036. Those from last year include infants or younger juveniles in 4005/4029, 4012/4027, 4011/4026. A burial identified last year as 4003 turned out to be the skull of a large mammal, but an adult human was identified this year in the same general location (L4034).  With the exception of 4023, all of the burials exhumed this year were laid out with their heads to the west or southwest and feet to the east or northeast. 4023 was unarticulated and lacked visible orientation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of all the burials in A4 identified this year and last, 4006 and 4007 remain located and unexcavated. We failed relocate either 4002 or 4010, though both are presumably still interred. This is especially true of 4010, which was an adult sized ulna located along the margin of A4 and A6. A fair amount of the back dirt leaked under the edge of the plastic near 4010 and might have buried it more deeply than expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 2002 burials are notable for the presence of grave goods, especially jewelry. To date, all such material has been found with infant or juvenile (L4027) burials. These include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L4024	 1 bead necklace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L4026	 1 ceramic or glass bracelet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L4027	 1 bronze or copper earring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L4029	 3 ceramic or glass bracelets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L4036	 1 bead necklace, 1 earring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The necklaces found on L4036 and L4024 were superficially very similar. The earring found with L4036 was also notable. It was made with a center piece and a sequence of suspended beads and the string holding these beads together was still partially preserved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ceramic or glass bracelets found on L4026 and L4029 are also superficially similar. They each resemble a series of bracelets located in the Dyarbakir museum and labeled as Roman or Hellenistic in age. Although the age of the bronze earring is indeterminate at this point, Nevin Soyukaya of the Diyarbikir museum thinks the bracelets are made of glass and actually Medieval rather than Hellenistic. She noted that they are nearly identical to similar bracelets recovered from a well dated church cemetery in Mardin, Turkey some 100km away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyText" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;3.0 Excavation and Stratigraphy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As mentioned, excavations focused on two blocks of earth. A 4x4m area in the northeast of A4 ("north block") and a 2x4m area in the southeast (‘south block") I’ll discuss each in turn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A total of five loci were identified and excavated in the northeastern block: 4016, 4017, 4021, 4022, and 4023. The first three of these were identified by their stratigraphic position (top to bottom) and excavated sequentially over the entire 4x4m area. 4023 was identified by the presence of human hand bones and ended up being a roughly 50x50cm exploratory unit meant to trace out a large burial. No additional material was actually found, and 4022 was simply identified as the layer of dirt into which 4023 cut. Thus 4016, 4017, and 4021 have been removed and 4022 remains untouched. 4016, 4017, and perhaps 4021 can be collectively considered a band of undifferentiated topsoil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The south block was both smaller and more complicated due to the presence of numerous burials and other features. As in the northeast, work began by removing a series of loci in stratigraphic order until reaching evidence of human burials. These loci were 4018 and 4019 and again represent generally unconsolidated topsoil and subtopsoil. Less total sediment was removed in this part of the trench prior to seeing human remains, possibly because it sits higher on the site and has seen more erosion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two burials identified were 4024 and 4025, and each cut into an underlying deposit identified initially as 4020 (similar in position and concept to 4022). Although 4020 was initially thought to span the entire 2x4m area, rocks and also oven material were noted in its western extent as early as 7/15/02. Because initial work focused on the burials, no attempt was made to subdivide the area. This would change after the burials were removed and it was decided to remove the remaining layer of 4020 down to the level of the 4013/4040 rock feature (cist tomb) during the last week. At this point, work showed the eastern one third of the trench to be clearly different from the west. The area was assigned locus 4037 and considered separately from 4020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work on the two burials in the main trench floor (4029, 4034) resulted in several locus assignments during excavations. Because the 4003 burial from last year turned out to be non-human and because a large amount of animal bone came from the southern end of the A4 main trench last year, the floor of the trench in the last meter or so was assigned L4028. The trench floor in all other parts of A4 (at roughly 603.5m) was assigned 4035. This includes the floor of the north-south and east-west branches. The locus 4005/4029 burial was then sufficiently traced out to determine its orientation was east west, and work began on removing a 50cm wide strip along the western edge of the south block in order to make space for work and exhumation. While removing 4020 in this area we identified an area of softer fill in the center of the strip (4031), an area of much harder, mud-brick like fill in the south (4030), and relatively undifferentiated fill in the north (4032). All were located under 4020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsequent excavations in 4020 and 4037 would show that 4030 was a roughly 50cm wide strip of hard, mud-brick like fill running east-west along the southern margin of the south block covered by 4020 and covered by and partially abutting 4037. 4031 fill is actually part of the 4034 burial, which paralleled 4029 but which actually ran into the south block. 4031 and 4034 are thus identical. 4032 is now considered to be part of locus 4039, which is the layer of dirt underlying 4020 in the west part of the south block above the 4035 trench floor. At the close of excavations this year, the south block is a 2x4m area of sediment and cultural debris extending some 15-20cm above the L4035 trench floor. The block is basically divided into three areas: an area of undifferentiated fill in the western two thirds of the block (4039), an area of fill with numerous rocks and fragments of oven fill in the eastern one third of the block (4037), and a strip of hardened, mud brick fill running along the southern margin (4030). 4039 and 4037 are each then cut by other features including burials, the 4040 rock feature, and the 4033 ashy pit or midden. Nothing cuts 4030.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We did not work with the L4004 rock alignment in the north-south (L4000) portion of A4 this year and it remains. We also did no work in the deeper sounding at the very northern extent of A4. Since this area was and remains covered by plastic and backdirt, it does not show up on any of this years top plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span class="bodyText" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;4.0 Directions for further work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.1 Burials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we take the current evidence at face value, it appears that the burials may span many centuries. However, the dating remains problematic. On the recent end we have the presence of intact string in the one earring and a year 2000 burial with a C-14 bone date from the last hundred years. Unfortunately, the standard error on the C-14 date comes with a 95% CI of plus or minus 800 years and the presence of string is no guarantee of a recent origin. On the other end we lack clear confirmation of the age of the bracelets. The L4029 burial clearly post-dates the Early Iron Age, having been cut through deposits associated with that time period. No evidence of Roman or Hellenistic period occupations have been found in any part of the excavations so far, however, strengthening the hypothesis of a Medieval origin but still leaving the question of how late open to debate. All of this points to a continuing need to arrange for the direct dating of a larger sample of human bone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next seasons excavations would be well served by acquiring funds to date directly the human material and then selecting the broadest possible sample of skeletal material. Rather than focusing on one area (e.g. A4), sample from some of the other burials identified in 2001 in trenches A3, A5, A6, and A7. Aim not only for variation spatially, but also stratigraphically, selecting burials which have occurred deeper in the deposits. Consider extending some excavated units deeper in the hope of finding additional material. Many of the burials located to date either are or appear to be from younger individuals and occur at quite shallow depths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Non-burial features&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L4040 was identified toward the end of last year (2001-L4013) and consisted of a large, 50x80cm piece of flat stone bordered on the north, east, and west by smaller rocks and extending into the southern sidewall of the L4008 part of the A4 trench. A similar arrangement of rocks was found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="background:#ff0000" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;A7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (A6 L.6010?) and their removal revealed an associated human burial. Because of the similarity in construction and presumed content, both features were considered "cist tombs".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After removing dirt from around 4040 we found additional associated stones, again reminiscent of a burial. We then removed the large, flat stone originally identified last year and the smaller rock bordering it on the north. Below this was a 3-4cm thick layer of hard packed dirt sitting on top of another surface of mud brick, mud brick fill, and another stone similar in size to the first but offset to the northeast. We also noted several areas containing at least two courses of stacked stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although 4040 may well be a cist-tomb and cover a human burial, it is no longer clear-cut. We have simply designated it as an "unknown architectural feature". There are a large number of stones associated with oven debris located in 4037 just to the southeast and the intervening 4037 fill should be removed to see if they articulate with 4040. 4040 also appears as if it may extend further to the north and east, and needs to more fully exposed before removing additional stones. We opted to leave this for next season and to concentrate on existing burials in A4, G6, and D5. If these stones do actually cover a burial, the remains will stay well protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A second area of interest untouched during this season involves the architecture and burials in A5. Several rock foundations possibly associated with iron-age occupations and cross cut by human burials were located in A5. It would be useful and interesting to trace out these foundations with the goal of defining clear-cut interior and exterior contexts of complete or nearly complete buildings. One could then use this information to help identify interior and exterior surfaces, track assemblage variation, identify possible work areas, and mark the association, if any, with visible burials. While the mixed nature of the fill in this area makes this a challenge, I think the difficulty is offset by the relative ease of exposing larger spatial area. Similar comparisons would be prohibitive in older and deeper soundings covered by several meters of overlying occupations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p/&gt;
