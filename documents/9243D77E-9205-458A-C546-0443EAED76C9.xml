    <arch:note>
      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

      <arch:string>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Journal / Summary:A-2-2000-Journal&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 22, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since we did not lay in the trench until this morning, this is day 1 of our trench, but day 2 of the excavation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we began excavating Locus 2000 of our illustrious step trench, we planned to arbitrarily pick a half-way mark on the slope and cut into the hill to bring the topsoil to a horizontal plane even with the elevation of our arbitrarily chosen half-way mark. The dirt removed from this 2m x 1m setion contained mixed (?) potsherds but no interesting features. After breakfast Our Leaders decided to change the plan for the step trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the same locus (2000) we measured 1m on the east-west axis and designated half of the square for quick dirt-removal (east side first). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began digging with the intent of bringing the east side down to a horizonhtal plane even with the northern edge of the square. When we had almost reached the base of the east section, we found several medium sized stones and a chip of mudbrick at the southern-most edge next to the baulk. Bradley recommended articulating the stones, making a rough sketch and take a few elevations and then remove the stones and finish the section. Our fantastic digger Meki dug out a few more stones in the south part of the section , and we think they are either floaters or at best part of a fallen wall (or pit?).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andy looked at the baulk with the sprayer and decided that nothing new was appearing in the stratigraphy so we decided to bring the west section down to the same horizontal plane as the east section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had Meki pick the hell out of the west section and move it quickly. Close to the base on the far west edge we hit rocks again. We articulated them for Andy’s review and he determined that the stones could not be part of a wall because of the arbitrary angle along which the stones lay and only one stone appears to have a second course below it. Because it was the end of the day, we took elevations, cleaned up and left the stones for tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 23, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we assigned locus #2001 to the rocks we uncovered in the west section of Locus 2000. The piece of mudbrick associated with these rocks led us (and Andy) to believe this is not a wall collapse but possibly a clay oven.  We took elevations of the stones, removed them and bagged the pottery etc. and cleared the dirt to the level of the surrounding locus 2000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We then measured one meter downhill on the north side of the trench and brought the section down to a horizontal base equal to the elevation of the northern-most edge of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We found NOTHING interesting but we erroneously assigned a new locus #2002 to this 2m x 1m area beause we thought it would produce differend aged material than locus 200. The problem is that this 2mx1m L2002 area is mostly (all?) topsoil and is equal to L2000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;to further compact the problem with the locus numbers, we kept the same locus 2002 to dig the east half of our now 3m x 2m trench. We dug the 3m x 1m eastern half to make it level with the northern-most edge of the trench . We found some mudbricks very close to the bottom and when Andy sprayed the baulk, he believed he saw a possible plaster surface. He and  Bradley Bay recommended that we continue diging this eastern section of L2002 for another 20cm so they can see better what is in the baulk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we had removed this 20cm of dirt, we found several intact mudbricks with flat surfaces and contoured edges. We aso found a large-ish potsherd positioned with the rim downwards on its side with some burn-aterial resting on it in th ebaulk. Very close to this sherd in the SE corner, ther eis a lot of burn-evidence on what may be a survace, about 2cm lower than the bottom edge of the aforementioned potsherd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We cleaned up the trench and in doing so found a piece of jawbone w/ a mola tooth still intact. We don't know yet if it is human or animal, but might be a pig.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The soil associated with the level where we fond mudbrick is harder than the loose fill-loam above (L2000) and (L2002 upper part of section'). L2002 contained many small field stones/cobblestones and lots of roots that may have caused the soil to be so loose in the upper section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;tomorrow we will correct our elevation problems and rethink our locus numbers ato accomodate L2001 and potentially dig deeper on the east side of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 24, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started the day by taking elevations and correcting some errors from yesterday's dayplan. We drew the tooth and potsherds and burn area in the base of L2002 east section, removed the tooth to preserve it and may possibly change the locus once we begin digging again on the east side, because the burn markes and potsherds and bone may be related to a surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we determined that the remaining section of dirt in the west half of the trench should be divided into 3 loci because the outermost edge (L2000) is still the loose topsoil from the shallow section of soil continuing down the slope of the tel. Just under this loose topsoil is a stratum of similar fill-like soil that contains several medium sized rocks (L2002). Below that level the soil becomes hard and dense and many mudbrick pieces are evident in the baulk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We covered the floor of the east section with bags to prevent mixing/messing up the loci and first removed L2000 from the west section, then took elevations and removed L2002 and then took elevations again and removed L2003. A piece of obsidian ame out of the baulk of 2003 just as we bgan to dig--it is a fragement of a knife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2000=loose fill, crumbly silt loam w/few rocks or cobblestones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2002=crumbly fill, silt loam w/lots of cobblestones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2003=harder soil, densely packed with lots of mudbrick fragments and some burn evidence in the floor and in the baulk after removal of the locus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next we attempted to measure 2m further downhill to start a new stop, but due to problems with laying-in the lines on the very steep incline, we will hae to re-think and try again tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, we removed the remaining 20cm x 1m x 2m section of L2002 on the north edge of the trench. Then our tent blew away in the wind and the workers had to go home anyway, so we will finish the section tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;so now we hae ONE DEEP square 2m wide x 3m long approx. 2m deep and on a treacherous slope with chopped out steps to scramble uphill!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 25, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started the day by cleaning up the north section of the trench and taking a million elevations. Set upthe next step downhill as a 2m x 2m but we will not dig there yet. We had to use a 2m rod with 6m of string attached and a plumb bob to run the lines downhill because of the sharp incline. There may be some minor error in the alighnment, but the square measures2m on each side fairlypreciselydespite all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;First we dug down the formerlylevel floor of the trench on the north side, starting at 1m from the south baulk and extending out to the north edge. We dug down 25 cm, took elevations. We called this L2002 because it is still a sub-topsoil layer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we dug down the SW section below L2003 of our former 3m x 2m trenchand assigned a new locus 2004 because we believe we had hit a floor at the base of 2003. The soil in 2004 was very hard packed compared to what we had come across thusfar. We pulled out a flat stone (for bread?), several pig (?)  bones and some nice pot sherds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next we dug down the north section as locus 2005 which is equivalent to 2002 sub-topsoil layer so that our loci numbers would work correctly. This section begins 150 cm from the south baulk and extends to the northern edge. We dug down circa 25 cm. This section was fill, loose sub-topsoil with some stones but not as many stones as the 2002 section between the south baulkand the 2meter pin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 26, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Todaywe got a 3rd workman so we could bust thru more topsoil. We started moving topsoil as L2000 from the northern-most 2m x 2m square that we had measured off yesterday. We used the floor of L2005 at the 3m pin from the south baulk as the reference to dig out L2000 so that its floor would be on the same elevation level as 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simultaneously we took off the SE corner (1m x 1m x 25cm section of 2004 east) which had the burn marks and potteryon the floor and in the baulk (see journal p.5 July 24). Once that 1m x 1m was removed, L2004 was a "flat" surface extending 150 cm from the south baulk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we straightened the baulks with a plumb bob and levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While that was happening, we had the workers cut the northern edge of the step corresponding to the 3m pin--first 50cm north of the pin as L2000, on the east side only (leaving the west side [ie., 1m wide] so Bradley and Andy can see the section/stratigrahy). Then we cut thesection 35cm south of the 3m pin on the east side as L2005. This split was made so that there would be no contradiction between this layer of locus and the loci above it that meet at the 3m pin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then because we had a little time left, we had the workers take out the L2000 section off the west 1m up to the 3m pin. We will take out the small 1m wide x 35cm long section of 2005 on Friday (perhaps?).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 2000 = loose topsoil mixed slope debris, not as manyrocks as the southern sections of the trench topsoil ad subtopsoil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 2004 SE corner = hardpack soil with several bones and sherds, some mudbrick chunks but not as much as SW corner. Baulk shows burn marks several cm above the current floor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 28, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we started by digging out the west half (1m x 150cm) section of L2005 down to the level of L2000 on the north end of the trench. We came across a potsmash, or part of one anyway, at elevation 98.20 in the far west edge at coordinates: 230-250cm from the south baulk and 27-50cm from the west baulk. The soil under the sherds was hard-packed, like mudbrick (?) but the soil at the same elevation around the sherds was loose like the subtopsoil layers (2002 and 2005) have been so far. A piece of obsidian also came out of this section, almost at the base of the section (circa elev 97.74). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regarding that partial potsmash, I don't think it is anything more than a larger-sized floating sherd because the soil around it is rather loose and no other interesting sherds cam eout of the section right around it, although we got a nie spout (not the same thickness nor claycolor as the partial potsmash) underneath the smash at approx elev 97.83.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next we took the south section L2004 down 17cm to the level of the remaining east section of 2005. This is still the sub-burn/occupation level. We will change locus when we reach the top of 2005 because we are getting deeper into the tel on the south side and may be deep enough below the burn line where 2003 meets 2004 so that we could be in a new ocupational period?? Some bones came up in this 17 cm deep section of 2004, maybe pig bones like the rest of what we've found including some good incisors. Maybe goat teeth; a whole lot of them! These teeth are resting on a great mudbrick surface or wall. These mudbricks are well articulated bricks with morter lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We assigned a new locus 2006 to these mudbricks and the area to the west of the bricks as Locus 2007 because there are potterysherds on the floor and in the baulk that mayhelp date the mudbrick; also the western edge of the mudbricdks appear to have collapsed into that SW corner of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also assigned a new locus 2008 to the area north of the mudbrick and the mudbrick-collapse area. The east half of this locus has several smallish cobblestones littering the floor. This maybe a surface so we will dig down the western half 25cm tomorrow and look at the section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yea! We finally found some cool and interesting stuff!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 29, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started by taking the elevations at the burn marks and pottery sherds corresponding to the bottom of Locus 2002/ top of Locus 2004 in the SE corner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pottery = 98.78&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;SE corner = 98.76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;burns on south baulk = 98.76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus the corrections we made to the dayplan for 7/24/2000 should be okay, hopefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next we had Meki dig off the top layer of 2008 east so that we could see what thecorrespondence is between 2008 west cobblestones and 2008 east cobblestones. We foud the base of a wall, which we thought yesterdaymight be a cobblestone stuface. This cobblestones wall appears to abut a mudbrick wall extending into L2005. The cobblestones could also be a walk-waybetween mudbrick structures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Meki was digging 2008 we measured another 10m downhill, expectin g to lay the corner pins and gradually step down 2m at a time measuring each 2m with the plumb bob and line level, since that method was impossible for the entire 10m all at once--the hill is too steep. We laid in the first 2m section and will start diggging after breakfast as Locus 2000 topsoil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We dug the northern-most 2m as a two-part step, all as locus 2000, digging 1m from the 5m pin so that the section was level with the earth at the 6m pin. We did the same for the section of dirt, starting at the 6m mark and extending to the 7m pin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the workmen cleared L2000 from the 5m-7m pin section, we articulated bones (pig?) on the SW corner Locus 2007. There are some nice white teeth and possibly part of a skull (pig? goat?). I think this SW corner might be a pit or a collapse area that came to be used as a pit or dump of some kind because there are so many bone scraps and pot sherds, none of which really seem to rest on a continuous surface at this point in our excavations. While Meki articulated some  of these bones and a few in-context potsherds, we scraped the baulk of 2008 adjacent to 2005 because we think the base of 2005 shows mudbrick; maybe another wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before we started scraping the baulks, we measured out another 2m between the 7m pin and the 9m pin and had the workmen start digging L2000 there also--in the same wayas the section of L2000 between the 5m and 7m pins. Locus 2000 is full of roots and some rocks and is nothing more than topsoil slope erosion; very little pottery, lithics and bone came out of these step sections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we continued cleaning up L2007 for photos (which will have to wait til tomorrow) we had the workmen take out the dirt  between the 5m and 6m pins as well as the dirt between the 7m and 8m pins as L2002--subtopsoil. This too was riddled with roots and contained verylittle pottery. The workmen recovered NO bone and NO lithics from L2002, although I think it is more because they are lazy (not Meki) and have been dragging their feet all day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meki ran the dirt from L2007 across the screen and we also collected a soil sample from L2007 since it has a good context preserved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summary of First Week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are digging a step trench down the north side of the tel with the intention of getting as deep into the hillside to find some good stratigraphy in the baulk in order to help date the sequence of occupation. We also plan to extend the trench as far down the hill as feasible. We have been peeling off the topsoil and sub-topsoil in layers as we go down the hill. Thus we have lots and lots of Locus 2000 (topsoil) and Locus 2002/2005 (subtopsoil).  Within 1m of the top of the tel we found a part of a clay oven and some burn marks in the baulk, possibly indicating a surface although we never found that surface. As we pushed down in the southern section of the trench, we hit a lot of mudbrick and finally on day 7 of the dig we hit a well articulated mudbrick wall in the SE corner. We also discovered a cobblestone surface (or foundations of a wall??) to the north of the mudbrick wall in the SE corner AND we then discovered another mudbrick wall running on the north side of the cobblestone surface/wall-foundation. In the SW corner beside the mudbricks in the SE corner, we believe we will be able to date the layer because there is collapse from the mudbricks that seem to fill the area to the west, which contains lots of animal bones (pig/goat?) and some good pieces of pottery stuck in the baulk and at the same level as the bones. As we dig further downhill towards the north, we are coming up with nothing but roots in the topsoil and subtopsoil layers, although the southern section has finally become fruitful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we articulated more of the bones and potsherds in L2007 and believe there may be rocks/cobbles corresponding to the cobblestones of L2008. We also articulated more stones in the eastern part of L2008 ad realized that the far NE corner of the cobble strip has cobbles only at a lower level/elevation than the surrounding cobbles; ie., there is a pocket of lower cobbles; maybe a pit??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had the workmen dig down between the 4-5m pins as L2002 subtopsoil and came up with a pocket of hard-packed soil in the SW corner of this section--maybe mudbrick??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The workers also cleaned up the area between the 7m and 9m pins, which they had begun yesterday but did not finish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal July 31, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start by cleaning up L2002 between 4m and 5m pins and continuing to dig for those cobblestones in L2007 and L2008. We have extra workers today, so we will have them work on the trench steps while we are doing fine-tuning on L2007 and 2008 in preparation for locus number change. That area of cobblestones will become L2009 and the north course of mudbrick adjacent to the cobbles will become 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We took out a new chunk of L2002 between the 3m and 4m pins, working in 1m x 1m sections, east side first. We hit harder soil close to the level-base of the section between the 4m and 5m pins. When we dug the western half of the 3m-4m section, we hit hard soil with some burn-ash-dirt in the baulk and some clay-oven scraps, but no in-tact oven. We stopped digging when we hit distinctly harder soil, although I am not convinced that this is mudbrick yet--it may be a bit closer to occupational layers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also had the workers hack out L2002 between the 6m and 7m pins, 50cm deep to start and potentially more unless they hit anything interesting. We separated the L2002 KT bags today because we collected pottery/lithics/bone from three areas:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	1. cleaning up b/w 4m and 5m pins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	2. digging w/b 3m and 4m pins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	3. digging b/w 6m and 7m pins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because these three areas are on significantly different levels/elevation of the slope, we separated bags to better determine from whence our materials are being recovered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We picked up and bagged all the bones and sherds off the surface of L2007 and articulated the cobbles--which run fairly continuously in an L-shape around the SE corner-mudbricks in this L2007 area, we found a nice (albeit small) piece of basalt grindstone. We also finished cleaning up L2008 and had Drew photograph everything. The NE corner of L2008 seems to be a depression/ pit of lower level cobbles compared with the rest of L2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next we started digging toward the L2010-mudbrikcs starting from the northern edge of what had previously been L2005, starting at the 3m pin and working southwards 1m.  This section between the 3m pin and L2010-mudbricks is now L2011 because it is a context adjacent to mudbrick and may contain material that will help date the mudbrick-and-cobbles combo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We missed all of our closing elevations today for various unworthy reasons so we will start tomorrow by measuring 30 of them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal August 1, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began by taking forty-thousand elevations (30 really) and cleaning up unfinished sections from yesterday in L2002 between the 6m and 7m pegs. While the workmen swept up the overnight debris from the trench, we laid out a new 2m x 2m square downhill at the northern edge. This will be L2000 once we begin digging it; maybe tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We dug out between the 5m and 6m pins as L2002 subtopsoil and found the scraps of a possible Tandor/ Ekmek firin oven in the SE corner of this section (at the orth side of the 5m pin). We dug this 1m x 2m section in two parts--east side first, and then west side after determining from the section/ stratigraphy that we had not missed anything significant. Tandor/oven Munsell color: 5YR 6/6 "reddish Yellow"  Just beside the Tandor/oven we found a significant portion of a basalt grindstone AND also a circular rock with a hole in the center (possible door post/pivot?) and another chunk of basalt at elevation 96.31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We (uh, Andy) also scraped the base of L2002 between the 3m and 4m pins and found a color change on the west side: a large-ish/square-ish area of pinker soil: Munsell color: 7.5 YR 5/4 "brown" with surrounding soil Munsell color 10YR 5/3 "brown". We also think we can see an area of yellowish soil to the east of that pink patch: Munsel color: 2.5y 6/3 "light yellowish brown".  We think we may be getting mudbricks here again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We continued digging north of our L2010 mudbrick wall where L2011 was yesterday, but we changed locus number to L2012 because yesterday we cleared off L2011's softer soil and hit the harder soil on top of L2012. Meki dug down the east section of 2012 and up to the north-edge of 2010 mudbricks and we think we have found the mortar lines in the section.l We also think we found the top (?!) of some mudbricks in 2012 flush against L2010. The dirt above it within L2012 was a little hard but what we hit in the SE corner of L2012 looks like mortared mudbricks--contiguous with L2010. Locus 2012 Munsell color: 10YR 6/3 "pale brown" and was significantly harder soil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sample of color from L2010: Munsell 10YR 6/2 "light brownish grey"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug between the 7m and 6m pins so that the base of that section L2002 became level with the "floor" of the 7m-9m pin section. Again we dug in two halves--first the east section then the west section. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the same time Meki cleaned and dug L2012-west to the level of the mudbricks we found on the east side of L2012. There we found a piece of an obsidian knife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 2, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We dug today in L2012 between the 4m pin and L2010 to try to clarify the mudbricks we had found. We shaved off the "floor" of L2012 to make it as level asl possible with the northern edge at the 4m pin. The section of L2012  between the 3m and 4m pins was L2002, but since that section (3m-4m) was turning up the same type of hard packed material, including reddish and yellowish mudbrick evidence, we assigned a new locus number 2012 to make it continuous with the soil directly adjacent to L2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also carved the "floor" of L2002 between the 5m and 6m pins so that it is as flat as possible, preserving the doorpost/grindstone at the edge of the 6m mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we began to dig the section of soil between the 4m and 5m mark as L2013 because the soil there may be related to the clay oven stuck in the baulk of that section. Very soon after we had begun to dig, (at elev. 96.53) we hit a burn-area in L2013 in the west half. We took a soil sample in 2 places and pushed down in the east, finding a well-preserved plaster floor. We were also able to articulate the entire oven stukc in the east baulk of L2013. Almost the entire oven is preserved! There were 4 or 5 large stones (cobble stones or architectural stones?) on/above this plaster surface which we articulated and left in place for now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had extra workers from other trenches come over to help us out, so we set them to work pounding out new steps downhill.  Beginning at the 9m pin, we pushed down in 1m sections as L2000 topsoil. Because this is all surface trash/slope wash, we used the same KT bags for each step. After the workmen had cleared out these L2000 steps, we had them bust out between the 8m and 9m pins as L2002 subtopsoil, bringing that section down to the level of the 9m-10m L2000 section.  Thus at the end of the day the 8-10m section is a "flat" surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also had the workmen "flatten" the section between the 11m and 12m pins as L2002 subtopsoil, although they did not quite finish; they left a 30cm long section of L2000 sitting there until we dig it again on Saturday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow is Lab Day, but we will go to the site and set up a new datum so we can get the readings on th elower levels of our now 13m long trench. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started by finishing the section of 2002 between the 11m and the 12m marks. After sweeping up in the southern section we began digging L2012 starting at the 4m pin and working southwards, east side first. After only 5 swings of the pick we hit what looks like cement-imbedded stones (which turned out to be Dicle conglommerate).  They are larger stones than in L2009, but may still be considered cobbles. Maybe this is part of a defensive wall-system?? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These rocks at the north edge of L2012 ended soon after they began--only about 50cm x 30cm were covereed by the rocks and Dicle conglommerate we continued digging the east side down to the elevation of these rocks and stopped at the south end adjacent to L2010 because the mudbricks we were intentionally cutting through became much harder. Our purpose was to catch the depth of the L2010 mudbrick wall in section. We then dug the west half of L2012 southwards until we again hit very hard mudbrick, the top of which we had already identified at the junction of L2011 and 2012. The baulk section shows varying colors of yellowish brown in the west baulk, approx beneath the area where we had found pink and yellow mudbrick in L2002 between the 3m and 4m pins right before we switched to L2012 on Aug 01. Munsell= ________________&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also moved L2002 subtopsoil betwen the 8m and 10m pins, very slowly  because of lazy workmen (ie., Ihsan and Byron).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we got a slow start to digging because we needed to let Drew make top-plan photographs of the trench from 0m to 5m marks. While he was working on that, we worked with Andy to set up a new Datum for our trench. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	New Datum (A) value= 94.02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After breakfast we proceeded with the day's dig plan and took out the top layer of cobbles L2009 which are visible between L2006 and L2010 mudbrick walls. We found several oddly worked stones--one with bore-marks on two sides and 3 stones with unusual striations that we thought might either be a result of sharpening stone or metal knives OR a result of carving a hold for string/rope to hold the rock better--as in loom use or some other hanging/weight system??  We also found 3 pieces of basalt, each of which appears to be chunks of grindstones. There was also an odd square-ish/flat-ish stones with possible char marks on one side--as though it had been used to strike fires?? Maybe we are insane but it is fun to speculate about these stones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We screened every one in three buckets and recovered only a little bit of material that we had not already caught visually. (This may be partly due to Sedat who is a good worker but is new to archaeology and may not recognize all the tiniest bits of bone/pottery, etc.) We kept a soil sample (2liters) for flotation but I'm afraid that there may be a little  bit of surface debris from the junk that flies into the trench overnight. This includes bits of hay or whatever that goundcover is on the Tel. We swept and cleaned before beginning to dig out the cobbles today, but ewhenever it is windy during the day some suface junk inevitably floats back down and it is frankly hard to get every tuft of hay/grass out that drifts down in between the articulated cobbles. (mea culpa).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The soil between the cobbles of L2009 was loose-pack as though it was NOT mortared and not mudbrick--the handpick and trowel readily scraped it away, although it was not just powdery slope trash like L2000 and L2002 were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The SE corner where the cobbles abut the NE corner of L2006 mudbrick wall ha da change of color (Munsell=_____________) to a more golden-brown compared to the surrounding grey-brown. No unusual rocks, nor bone, nor lithics, nor pottery came out of this new-color-area, so we kept digging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The exciting thing is that we are now circa 20cm deeper than the top of L2009 cobbles /top of L2006 mudbrick and we we can now see beautifully in section the mudbrick construction on the north side of L2006--long thin bricks stacked neatly! Pretty exciting stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note--the odd rocks and basalt grindstone pieces we found lead me to believe that some domestic activity was going on in this area L2009 cobblestones. One more thing--in looking at the area of L2012 where it abuts L2010, we think that the mudbrick wall and the adjacent mudbricks do not run perfrectly parallal and the mudbricdks in the NW corner of L2012 between the 3m and 4m pins is of a different color, arrangement and hardness than the mudbricks of L2010 and adjacent mudbricks of south part of L2012. I.e., the colorful mudbricks of 3m-4m section NW in L2012 are arranged as though tthey were stacked on their narrow edge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think L2006-2009-2010 are a unit of some sort because of the way the loci are aligned whereas I think the mudbricks of L2012 and L2014-15-16-17 to the north are something entirely different. And given that L2014-15-16-17 appear to be an area of domestic (?) occupation (i.e. oven/pit/plaster floor) I wonder which came first--the defensive wall or the house to its north? or is it a watch-guard dormitory?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;First today we removed the last of the three layers of cobblestones in L2009. Le took elevations using Datum 1, although our opening eleations were done using Datum A (i.e., closing elevations from yesterday were done with Datum A). Because we only removed one thin layer of cobblestones this morning--eualing only a few (3-5cm) cm or so-and because Datum A is a hair "off", our L2009 closing elevations look like we were replacing dirt rather than removing it. We went back later and double checked the estimated opening based on the remaining cobbles in the baulk and recorded both elevation-readings on the dayplan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We changed locus to L2018 because under the last cobbles of L2009, we hit dirt-pack. This layer contained lots of debris; i.e., pot sherds (Hellenistic??) and bones. After removing this soil which was loose-packed and rather like the rest of the silty loam we have been seeing every day, we changed locus to L2019. This change of locus was because after clearing out dirt of L2018, we hit a new layer of cobblestones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These L2019 cobblestones appeared to run underneath L2006-mudbrick wall and in fact once we romoved the rocks of L2019 we could clearly see that the L2006-mudbrick wall restos ON TOP OF these cobbles. Whether this cobble suface is a floor or a foundation is a matter of conjecture, although I would lean towards "surface" and away from "foundation".  I would think this L2019 was a SURFACE because of the pottery and bone debris in the dirt overlaying the cobbles. Also the cobbles were only one-layer thick and I would guess that a wall FOUNDATION needs more support than one simpole course of randomly sized, rounded and randomly placed cobbles as a base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After clearing the cobbles of L2019 we continued digging just a few cm to be sure we got all the cobbles, but changed KT bags in case the dirt we were moving turned out to need a new Locus #. And we decided after we found no new cobble layer that indeed the dirt underneath L2019 needs a new locus # 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interlude: Locus 2020 was assigned to the newly surfacing mudbrick wall that sits in the SW corner of the trench. The cobbles of L2019 also run underneath L2020 mudbrick, while the cobbles of L2009 surround and overlay the mudbrick of L2020. I think there is a relationship between L2006 and 2020 because of their situation over L2019 and because they seem to run roughly parallel, although we accidentally hacked off some of the mudbrick material from the NW corner of the L2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back to L2021: Because we missed the eleations when we switched KT bags before renaming the end of L2019 as 2021, (i.e., KT 2182-2185) we had to go back to the baulk to get elevations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More to avoid mixing layers than for any visual marker, we changed locus again after digging 7-10cm of L2021. The new locus 2022 is as yet unfinished. Our goal is now to press down through the soil between L2006-2020 and 2010 in order to find the base of mudbrick wall 2010 on the south side of that wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CBS came to the site today, so we got to showcase our trench after Bradley had his 15 minutes of Warholian fame. We climbed into the "bathtub" and posed a discussion about the seequence between the mudbrick walls. Yee-haw--t.v. land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we began cleaning L2022 in the south part of the trench and soon decided that we should change locus; in fact we decided to create 3 new loci. This area of 2022 became &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2024 waterdrain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2025 mudbrick south of waterdrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2026 mudbrick north of waterdrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we cleaned 2022 we collected no pottery, lithics or bone in the short time before we changed locus, thus there are NO KT BAGS corresponding with L2022 today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We assigned new L2024 to the possible waterdrain because it was a long narrow area of significantly looser soil compared to the mudbrick bounding it on both sides. We believe L2024 is related to L2010 because it runs parallel to that m.b. wall and NOT parallel w/L2020 nor with L2006 mudbrick walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We cleaned and straightened the baulks above L2025 and L2026 but we did not collect pottery, lithics, bone (because there was none to collect thus there are NO KT BAGS correstponding with L2025 and L2026 today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug at the north edge of former L2012 at the 4m pin as L2023 because we wanted to cut thru the mudbrick slough to clarify the better preserved mudbricks that we could see from the top--in order to catch them in section. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the top of this locus L2023 were the cobblestones we found at the edge of the 4m pin. We removed the rocks as part of L2023 because they did not appear to be anything more than a heap of random rocks. In retrospect these should have been their own locus, but that's tough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also scraped/trowelled flat the area of L2012 between new L2023 and the mudbricks north of L2010 in order to maybe define the mudbricks showing thru the top of L2012. We recovered no pottery lithics or bone from this area thus there are NO g.d. KT BAGS today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began by spraying down everything to see what we wil say goodbye to today an to see if we caught the mudbricks in L2023 yesterday. There are some stark, definite mudbricks showing in the section of L2023--small bricks, seemingly softer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began igging L2006 after taking several photographs. We removed the mudbrick down to the top of the cobblestone layer, i.e., to the level of L2019 cobbles. This hunk of mudbricks was separated from the cobblestones by a 1cm thick skin of mortar. In the NW corner of the remaining cobbles underneath L2006 is a basalt piece with a circular piece of basalt in the SW corner of the transition between L2006 and L2027.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2027 is the cobblestone layer beneath L2006 equivalent to L2019. Two chunks of the sam ebasalt doorpost(?) were in this cobblestone layer. We removed the cobblestones which were randomly (although still consistently) placed; there was only one course of cobbles--just as with L2019. I see no reason not to call L2019 and L2027 "equal". After removing the cobbles, the dirt we were looking at contained several chunks of charcoal at the northern edge elev. circa 97.87. We took a 'sterile' sample for carbon dating labeled L2028. The charcoal belongs w/ L2028, I think, because it is BELOW L2027 and on top of the new  L2028.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We changed Locus after finishing cleaning up after removing L2027. L2027 got a 2 liter soil sample and also got everything (i.e., all dirt) sifted on the screen. L2028 is hard packed mudbrick material made of silty loam. No significant color change is appearing compared to the soil in the baulk at the same elevation, and is similar to the color of the mudbricks of the wall L2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug L2002 between the 7m and 8m pegs down c. 30-40m just to the top of a mudbrick line we saw when looking with the sprayer at the north section. L2002 was the typical loose "trashy" subtopsoil with some animal burrows, root activity and nearly no rocks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug L2002 between the 10-11m pegs--no rocks came up, a little bit of bone and sherds came out. We stopped before reaching the base of this section, equiv. to the floor of the 11-13m section . We will finish tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we finished digging the section of L2002 between the 10m and 11m pins, which had been left unfinished from yesterday afternoon. This area of L2002 had lots of root ativity and some anial burrows. Soil is the same loose, junky subtopsoil as we have seen further up-slope in L2002.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then we dug between the 6m and 5m pins starting at the northern edge where the basalt grind-wheel/ doorpost thingy has been sitting for the past several days. We changed locus before digging to L2031 because we thought we were working towards occupational debris rather than merely continuing in mixed sub-topsoil. In the NW corner of L2031 we found the remnants of a clay oen. We pedestalled this and dug down a total of circa 25 cm to reach the top of some darker mudbrick material that we had seen in section using the sprayer (at the 6m pin.).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also worked in the southern-most part of the trench cleaning up the remnants of L2028 from yesterday in the SE corner. Then we took out the small wall of mudbrick L2020 in the SW corner. We did not screen any of L2020 because it is mudbrick which is not necessarily a good context to screen. We did screen all of the dirt from the underlying locus of cobblestones (L2029) which runs underneath the wall L2020. The cobblestones beneath L2020 corespond with the cobblestones underneath L2006 (i.e., cobbles there = L2027) and both of these cobblestone areas correspond with the single-layer of cobblestones L2019 which abut L2010 (mudbrick wall to the north of L2006 and L2020.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To finish our work in that SW corner we took out the mudbrick-debris packed beneath L2029, giving this mudbrick-dirt-pack a new Locus 2030. We did not screen this locus because it is such a small locus and we had already screened the material of L2028 which went with L2006 and L2027 in the SE corner (and we were feeling like simplifying under time pressure).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once we finished digging out the mudbrick wall in the SW, the entire southern section between the south baulk and the southern edge of L2010-mudbrick wall was a flattened area cut by the trough of L2024. Because the area south of L2024 trough included L2025 and the now-exposed dirt underneath L2028 and L2030, we renamed this area L2032 in order to consolidate loci and to keep the numerical sequence of loci numbers correct (i.e., L2025 cannot come BELOW L2028 or L2030!). Thus L2032 EQUALS L2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We dug the eastern half of L2032 down to teh level of the bottom of L2024 trough. This part of L2032 was VERY hard packed mudbrick material but we could not see any distinguishing mortar lines, so I am reluctant to call L2032 part of a wall. It may have been a hard packed surface at one time, but we found very little material, practically no sherds, lithics nor bone to help define L2032 as a surface of some sort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We left the western half of L2032 standing so we could look at it in section later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We then dug the small strip of mudbrick-packed dirt L2026 north of the trough-L2024 and abutting L2010-mudbrick wall. We were hoping to find the lowest course of mudbricks in L2010 by removing the dirt of L2026 to the south of the wall. We dug L2026 down to the level of the base of trough-L2024 but still we have not reached the bottom course of L2010 in section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug, at the 3m pin, the remaining section of L2012 which we had seen in section to be another type of mudbrick wall--smaller bricks and alternating reddish with yellowish bricks. We dug from the southern edge of L2023 southwards to the etremely hard-packed mudbricks to the north of L2010 (this extreme-pack mudbrick wall does not, as yet, have its own locus number but will get L2036 once we start digging it.).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We assigned locus 2033 to the section of softer mudbrick wall south of L2023 and up to that hard packed mudbrick wall (L2036). We only shaved off about 10-15cm (the equv of one course of bricks) such that L2023 and L2033 appear as a flattened area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note--Ellie was sick today so Barish ran the trench alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dug today in the south section of the trench--removed soil of L2032 finding very few bones, sherds, and lithics despite screening. Once L2032 was "flattened" such that it became levvel with the area to its east, we switched locus number to L2034 and dug down 20-25cm. L2034 was hard packed, possibly mudbrick collapse with very few sherds, bones, lithics floating in the soil.  We dug only the area south of the former divider/trough lines of L2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug between the 9m and 10m pegs as L2035. We switched locus because we were no longer in the sub-topsoil that came above this area.  We dug a total of 1m in depth in this area. We also straightened the baulks using a plumb bob all along the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we assigned new Locus number 2036 to the mega-hard packed mudbricks adjacent to L2010 on the north side of that mudbrick wall (i.e., 2010). This area L2036 was formerly left standing as L2012 but we now realize that a new locus is necessary because the hard packed brick wall is a different entity than the softer mudbrick wall of L2012 to the north of L2036.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we cleaned up the section of the trench between the 6m and 2m pegs in order to take top- and oblique-photographs of Loci 2031, 2014-2017, 2023, 2033 in preparation for removing more of L2023. We used the sprayer to define the section L2023/2033 and saw BEAUTIFUL mudbricks of yellowish color and made with river pebbles. This wall of mudbrick runs parallel to L2036 and L2010 behind that.  The wall (new locus assigned L2037) stops at 368cm from the south baulk in the east and stops at 343cm from the south baulk in the west.  This line is clear when seen from the top. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We decided to dig from the elevation drop at the north edge of L2023, assigning new locus L2039 to this piece north of L2037 southwards and stopping at the mudbrick line of L2037. We only dug 1m from the east baulk in order to preserve the western 1m of L2039 to view in section later.  Our purpose was to trace the plaster floor L2016 further southwareds adn in fact the plaster appears to continue, possibly underneath the yellow wall L2037 we found today. This wall will remain L2037 when we begin digging it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also cleaned up from yesterday's work in L2035 and in sweeping the now-flattened area between the 9m and 13m pins, we discovered a cmpletely preserved (Hellenistic?) bowl 11cm in diameter at elev. 93.29. Beside this pot about 20cm away was a large chunk of charcoal from which we took a sample for possible carbon-dating. This pot and charcoal are situated in L2002 which is subtopsoil so I don't know how useful a carbon sample will be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug L2034 in the south part of the trench a total of about 50cm. The soil in this locus was extremely hard-packed; like mudbrick, although we could see no brick-lines. We did, however, determine where L2010 ends by digging well below the last course of bricks. L2010 appears to be built on top of very hard-packed mudbrick debris with no brick-lines evident below the last (9th) course. At the end of the day we pushed down an extra 10cm in the eastern half of L2034, thus the western half is a step within the locus--we will take that down tomorrow. Note--several enormously thick cooking pot body sherds came out of L2034, especiallly in the eastern half, although no domestic markers (i.e., burns areas, concentration of bones, etc.) were evident. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we finished "flattening" L2034, the area south of our mudbrick fortress. We are now 3m deep at the south baulk!  This area of L2034 is more of the same hard-as-heck mudbrick pack with no tell-tale brick lines...are we plowing through something without seeing it?? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We dug L2039 west section only as deep as the equivalent top elevation of L2016 plaster floor in the east. We stopped digging at that elevation because there are plaster marks an dash making a line equivalent to the elevation of L2016 as we looked at the section on the north face of L2039. The plaster of L2016 that we had determined continues southwards from the former south-edge of L2016 also continues westward, stopping at a mudbrick or at least hard-packed dirt clod in the far west part of L2039.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We wanted to trace the plaster floor L2016 back to the south so we cut a 30cm wide section against the east baulk all the way through L2037-mudbrick wall.  We sprayed the oil and believe that the plaster surface L2016 DOES NOT continue underneath L2037-mudbrick wall. The base of the 30cm wide section we cut into L2037 appears to be the same material as L2037, i.e., same yellowish soil with lots of colorful smal-sized river pebbles. The plaster apears to stop at the northern edge/northern seam of L2037. NOTE we recovered no pottery/lithics/bone from L2037 because there was none to collect!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to better understand L2038, we continued digging our 30cm cut southwards adjacent to the east baulk, now cutting into L2038 all the way southwards until we hit the northern edge of L2036. This small section of L2038 contained a noticeable amount of raw clay greenish-grey in color and non-greasy in consistency. There was no pottery nor bone to collect, although we came up with one lithic piece.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also began digging L2010 today--startng with the "crest" all along the southernmost edge. We took this narrow strip of higher-elev. bricks (which had been chopped into when we originally excavated to find L2010 wall) down 40cm such that the top of L2010 bacame one continuous level with no artificial shelf as it had been before. Then we decided to treat the remainder of the wall in two halves: east and west. We removed the "facing bricks" on both the north and the south sides of the "body bricks", taking them down to the level where we can no longer determine new courses of brick on the south side--i.e., 40cm approx.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A "seam" 6cm wide that we see in the top of L2036 corresponded with a distinctive crack running vertically through the facing bricks on the north side of L2010. Once these facing bricks (or at least the upper 40cm of them on this north side--the facing bricks continue further down in depth on the north side than the facing bricks on the south side) had been removed, we saw clearly that this distinctive crack in the north-side facing bricks on L2010 CONTINUES and also appears very distinctively in the "body bricks" of L2010 on the north side. We believe that this major seam in L2036 corresponds to a two-phase construction sequence and the crack in L2010 corresponding to this "seam" in L2036 may be a result of shifting, or of major damage, or perhaps indicates that both L2010 and L2036 were constructed in two parts this way. HOWEVER the body and facing bricks on the south side must be examined before we can concretely say that a seam in L2010 is likely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe that the floor system L2016-L2014-L2015-L2017 is roughly contemporary with L2037 wall while L2038 represents mudbrick fill packed between L2037 and L2036. L2037 seems to be a house wall because it is softer and coarser in composition compared to the "defensive" walls to its south and L2037 has facing bricks only on the south side (i.e., the north side faces the interior of some entity.)  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2036 definitely goes with L2010 because of the way the walls were constructed flush against each other and they show continuous damage in the seam/crack correspondence.  L2036 and L2010 are very likely some kind of defensive wall or city wall of some sort. We think it is plausible that a house of some domestic/occupational space (or even fortification tower-dormitory??) is situated OUTSIDE the city walls--i.e., L2037 and the surface sequence L2014-17.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps digging down L2038 will help determine whether walls L2037 and L2036 are contemporary or whether wall L2036 runs much deeper and is therefore earlier (?) than L2037.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began today by taking down the rest of the facing-bricks on the north side of L2010 in the eastern half of the wall only.  After doing so, we saw a clear burn line running through the body of the wall L2010 at elev. 97.31. This burn line did NOT continue into what we formerly thought were the north-side facing bricks of L2010.  We now believe that the narrow strip of bricks between the body bricks of L2010 and L2036 belong together with L2036 as facing bricks on the SOUTH side of that wall. Thus the system looks like a layer cake when viewed from the top. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Running south to north--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2010 facing bricks--L2010 body --L2036 facing bricks--L2036 body &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We decided to trace the burn line of L2010 and determine where L2010 stops and L2036 starts by cutting a 25-30cm wide section into the two walls adjacent to the east baulk. We later learned that this was idiotic, but it was too late by the time we had cut this uselessly narrow section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;INTERLUDE:  This is pure speculation, but if we have seen facing bricks only on the south side of L2010 and also facing bricks only on the south side of L2037 (which is most likely a house or some domestic space of some kind), then is it possible that the facing bricks on the south side of L2036 are in fact not facing bricks but are instead buffer bricks between the two bodies of L2010 and L2036?  If the facing bricks of L2037 face outwards (i.e., away from the domestic space) then those facing bricks of L2037 may be said to be decorative and not load-bearing/structural. In the same way, is it possible that L2036 predated L2010 such that before L2010 was built, the south side facing bricks of L2036 were the "decorative" part of the wall facing inwards towards the town?  Then when L2010 was built, the wall was constructed flush against the facing  bricks of  L2036 and then L2010 wall got its own facing bricks on the south side to face inwards toward the town and function semi-decoratively?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More speculation--if L2038 is in fact fill an dnot a wall (still to be determined) then L2038 represents an alley or some space between the wall L2037 of a house (or whatever) and the city wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back to excavations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As it turned out 25cm was not sufficient to see a section of L2010 to trace the burn line, so we whacked the south-side facing bricks all the way down to the level of L2034. Once we had shaved off the facing bricks which did not show a strong enough burn ine to make a definite call, we looked at the body bricks. Indeed, the burn ine seen on the north side of L2010 continues thru the brick wall and is visible on the south side of the body bricks.  This allows us to say that wall L2010 ENDS at the burn line. We assigned a new locus to the material below the burn line L2040. Then we removed the entirety of L2010 down to the burn ine at elev 96.31.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug out the strop of dirt L2038 between walls L2036 and L2037 in order to help define the relationship between those walls. No determinations can be made as of yet--more on that tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
