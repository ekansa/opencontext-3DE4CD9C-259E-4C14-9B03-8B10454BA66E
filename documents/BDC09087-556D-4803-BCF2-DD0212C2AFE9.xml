      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 6, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today I am started a new trench in Area D, on the east slope of Kenan Tepe. Randy is in the next trench over, Trench 1, and is also responsible for Trench 3, a 2x2 sounding adjoining Trench 1 to the west. I am in Trench 2, which is directly to the North of Trench 1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the start of the day, Randy and I took elevations for all three trenches, and then spent some time rounding up workmen and tools. After that task was more or less completed, I had my workmen dig approximately 15 cm throughout the trench in order to clear out the layer of topsoil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While cleaning up L 2000, 2 chunks of basalt were discovered. KT 2003, in the SW quadrant of the trench, was a flat stone with a central hole. Though not complete, it appears to be some kind of weight. KT 2004 was found in the NW corner of the trench, and is a fragment of a grindstone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After all the dirt from L 2000 was removed, I decided to start the process of levelling the trench by opening a new locus below L 2000 and digging in the eastern half. L 2001 will be dug so that everything will be even with the lowest point, which is located in the NE corner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We continued digging this locus until the end of the day. Large amounts of pottery, several small finds, and one scorpion were found in L 2001, which consists of very loose, crumbly soil with coarse granules. Among the more interesting of the small finds was a large stone in the S balk, which appeared to be a complete, non basalt grindstone. It was large and heavy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another interesting object was found at the end of the day near the middle of the trench. It appeared to be a kind of concrete mixed with large pebbles. Andy says that it is a naturally forming concrete-like substance known as river conglomerate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will continue digging L 2001 tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 7, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we are continuing to dig in the eastern half of L 2001. The soil remains the same coarse granule texture, and it seems likely that we are still digging through a topsoil/wash layer from further up the hill. We are going to try to level the trench N/S first, and then work from there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After quite a bit of digging, we finally started finding some harder soil in the deepest part of the trench, that is near the center of the trench along the S balk. Andy came by and we decided to start digging in the western half of 2001, starting with a section on the north side of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Very shortly after we had started digging this section, the workmen uncovered a very nice cylinder seal, depicting on the side that wasn't covered with dirt a man fighting a lion. Also in this area was found a large donut shaped basalt weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The rest of the day was spent cleaning the sections, and removing all the dirt that was dug today. There remains some work to do tomorrow to level the area dug in the western half of the trench with that in the eastern half.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 8, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This morning we are digging out the remaining dirt from the area in the western half of the trench that was dug yesterday--it is not yet quite level with the eastern half of the trench. While we were doing this, I noticed a distinct line in the section below which the soil was much darker. While it may have been due only to a higher moisture content, I am having the workmen dig only to this level from now on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the above mentioned area was cleared out, we began digging the south central part of L 2001 to the level of the soil change. Nothing eventful was found in this area, and after cleaning it up we moved to the northwest quadrant of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While digging the eastern half of this area, a partial basalt grindstone was found in the section between what we were digging and the are that was dug yesterday. Later, we encountered several large rocks that appeared to be associated with each other. After articulating the rocks somewhat and searching the area for more (without success, though we did find a network of scopion/gopher holes) I decided to dig the western part of the northwest quadrant only to the level of the top of the newly found rocks. However, roughly 10-15 cm down in this area, the workmen encountered what appeared to be a cobble surface, similar to the path Randy had found in the sounding D3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We then decided to dig the southwestern quadrant of the trench to the level of the cobbles to see if they continued into this area. We dug 20 cm and did not discover a surface, just a few scattered cobbles. While it is possible that there may be more cobbles 10 cm or so lower, it seems most likely that the stones in the NW quadrant are just collapse from further up the hill. Nevertheless, we will continue to search a little bit more in the SW quadrant tomorrow. If nothing comes up, we will blast the western half of the trench down to the level of the larger stones found today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 9, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first thing I did today was remove a piece of basalt grindstone that had begun to surface yesterday in the SW quadrant of the trench. While I was documenting this find, the workers were struggling to set up our new giganto-tent. This morning I figure we will dig another 5 - 10 cm in the SW quadrant as L 2001. Then we will open a new locus and dig the entire western third of the trench to the level of the soil change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, while digging the SW, a couple of rows of large stones were discovered very early on. It may be a continuation of the path in Randy's sounding, however there does not appear to be a cobble surface (or any surface for that matter) associated with the rows of stones. In order to get a better idea of what is going on, we are taking down the pile of debris in the NW quadrant of the trench, and also digging down 20cm in the area immediatley to the east of the line of stones. After Drew photographs, we will take this area down to the level of the soil change as it appears to include only the same crumbly fill as the rest of L 2001.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While cleaning the trench for a photo, another chunk of basalt was found along the western balk. After Drew took a few shots of the stone lines, we took the area to the east of the stones down, and did not find anything interesting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the dirt from that section of L 2001 was cleaned up, we began excavating an area in the NW quadrant as L 2002. L 2002 turned out to be a fill with soil similar to L 2001. However, this locus contained many, many more stones and potsherds per square inch than L 2001. Many of the sherds appeared to be Hellenistic. The area of large stones documented on yesterday's day plan was found to extend to the western balk. L 2002 was closed today after the level of the soil change observed in L 2001 was reached. The soil was also noticeably harder at this point. The pile of stones in the middle of L 2002 will be excavated as a separate locus tomorrow. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have to do a lot of measuring and drawing in the next hour, and Drew also has to come and photograph the trench and rock pile. After the photo, the workers will be kept busy digging another 10 - 20 cm in the eastern part of the trench, still as L 2001 because we haven't gotten very deep below the surface at all in this area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow I will open a whole bunch of new loci in the western part of the trench, and hopefully the workers will be able to blast the area down quite a bit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 10, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This morning we started by cleaning up the rest of the dirt that was left over from digging in the eastern half of the trench ysterday afternoon. Nothing was found except for a few potsherds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also dug out the last remaining bit of L 2002, an small area along the west balk where a rock and a large potsherd had been pedestaled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today I am opening lots of loci. The line of rocks in the SW quadrant are now L 2003, and the area to the west of these rocks is L 2004. We are starting by digging L 2004 approximately 10 - 20 cm, to see if we can find a surface associated with the line of rocks. No surface was found, so L 2004 was closed, and the line of stones was removed as L 2003. This action completed, the entire raised area in the SW quadrant was dug as L 2005. While L 2005 was being dug, however, two potentially intersting areas were discovered. A pile of large stones was found in the northern section of the locus, and an area of very hard soil, with a few large stones, was found in the Southern part. Between these two areas, L 2005 was dug to the level of the soil change found on 8/8/2000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The area was cleaned up and Drew took a photo. After Bradley had decided that the hard soil in the SW corner was just random debris, we dug that area as L 2007 down to the level of the soil change from 8/8. The pile of large stones was dug as L 2006. Nothing exciting was found in either of these loci except for a small chunk of basalt that popped up in L 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After L 2006 was cleaned up, we moved on to dig the pile of stones in the NW corner, discovered yesterday, as L 2008. Another chunk of basalt was found here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We then worked on cleaning the balks for a while, and after that was finished, the workers dug a little further in the eastern part of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 12, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we are opening L 2009 in the west half of the trench and digging down level with the eastern half of the trench. So far nothing interesting has surfaced, although the area below L 2007 in the SW corner is continuing to be very hard, so we will dig that separately as L 2010. There was also a small (30 cm diameter) grouping of four stoness in the NW corner, but since they were small, floating, apparently random, and not near anything else, we removed them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When L 2009 is done being leveled, we may decide to divide the trench into quadrants and blast the SW one down until we hit something. However, in the process of leveling L 2009, we came across an extensive pit, or else just a very soft layer of dirt, covering most of the westen half of the trench, and some areas in the eastern half. In order to deal with this, we will close L 2009 and open L 2011 as a level of very soft fill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We spent the rest of the day digging L 2010, although it was not completely leveled by the time the workday was over. We will dig it flat tomorrow, and also open L 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 13, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we started by opening L 2011 in the western half of the trench and digging it down roughly 30 cm. An area of stones was found along the N balk. It doesn't look like much, but for now we are leaving it alone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Possible oven residue was found in three small circles near the center of L 2011. Soil samples were taken from each, but they were not given separate locus numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andy came by and noticed that L 2010 was still looking pretty rough from yesterday, so he had us clean it up. When he came back it was looking like there were some mudbrick lines in the W balk. so we brought L 2010 down a little further to level it and straightened the balks as best we could. After cleaning and spraying L 2010 and the SW corner of the trench, it seems that there is a mud brick wall in this area. We have probably cut through about 1.5 courses. Lines are visible in the balks, and also in the southern half of L 2010. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow we will scrape L 2010 down further in order to make the lines clearer. However, starting tomorrow L 2010 will be known as L 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 14, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andy and Bradley came by early this morning after we scraped L 2010 flat. We decided that the area was not well defined enough to be mud brick yet, so we are holding off on opening L 2012. Instead, we are going to take L 2010 down another 5 cm to see if we are able to start seeing mudbrick lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After removing 5 cm and scraping the area super flat, it looks less likely that there is a wall in this area. Bradley came by and noticed that the lines in the balk are starting to look more like sedimentary layers than brick: there are long continuous horizontal lines, but no vertical ones except for animal holes. In addition, the lines that were once faintly visible on the surface of L 2010 have now pretty much disappeared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now the plan is to flatten L 2011 and then to bring L 2010 down level with it. We will then decide what to do with the locus situation on the western half of the trench. In flattening L 2011, we continued to have the same areas of very soft soil that we had yesterday. Towards the middle of the locus there were again small areas of different colored soil. After we finished level the main part of L 2011, we started work on the pile of rocks along the N balk. There were quite a few stones in this area, but they appeared to be just tumble, so we kept them as L 2011. We did however, give the area its own KT numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When L 2011 was completely leveled, we started working on bringing L 2010 down. However, my workmen were starting to drag at this point, and in the time left we were only able to get half of L 2010 chopped. At some point while we were digging this section, Andy came by and said that he thought there still might be a wall in this area, but it might be lower down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tomorrow is my last day, so we will try and get a little deeper, but it is not looking likely that we will find anything. There are some stones starting to come up in the southern half of L 2011 however.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 15, 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are starting off today by finishing the excavation of L 2010, so that it is level with the rest of the western half of the trench. When that is complete, we will cleanup the trench and try and make sense of of the situation in the western half. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After digging and cleaning, we encountered no evidence that L 2010 was part of a wall. However, on the brighter side, it became apparent that the rocks uncovered yesterday in the southern half of L 2011 are actually part of a cobble surface. We troweled and explored the area a little further, and found definite edges to the surface. It does not cover a particularly large area, but it appears to be extending into the eastern half of the trench. In order to follow the surface, we are opening a section of the eastern half of the trench as L 2012. This locus appears equal to L 2001.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After L 2012 was dug and cleaned, we noticed that the surface appeared to continue further into the eastern half of the trench, but became consistently narrower as it continued. In order to try and figure out what was going on, we decided to extend L 2012 to cover the entire eastern half of the trench, and dig it down level with the surface. It should also be mentioned that an area of discolored soil was found in L 2012 near the center of the trench--possibly more oven residue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the excavation of L 2012 before the workday was over, so the extent and overall shape of the surface is still unclear. At this stage, it appears that it may be triangular in shape. It also includes quite a few potsherds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
