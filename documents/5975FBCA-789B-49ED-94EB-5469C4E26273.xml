      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;J. Henecke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today my goal was to articulate the walls I discovered yesterday so that I we can take an overview plan shot. There are two areas in particular where the mudbrick wall alignments are not very clear (L142 and 144), so I excavated in adjoining areas and scrapped these surfaces to get a better view. We removed about 20 cm of soil from L141, which is a general fill locus. It is a continuation of the mixed fill that has dominated that area. I also removed a few centimeters from L136, a fill locus of grayish soil in the western corner between L144 and the surface L134. In doing this, I was able to find the mudbrick edge of L144, but I was unable to identify any walls. It is possible that this area is a corner of another cell room that extends into the southwestern baulk. This cell room maybe filled in with mudbrick which would explain the apparent mudbrick debris within the locus. I could find no bounding walls for L142, and I believe the area has been cut by a pit. This area also appears as if it may have been another cell room that was filled in with mudbrick debris. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A profile of mudbricks that line up with L116 appears northwestern baulk, although there are no mudbricks connecting this profile to the wall. Above these bricks is a clear dark gray/black line, which we believe to represent an erosion line on the tepe during this period. An erosion line in this position has very interesting consequences for our interpretation of the activity in this area. The line may explain why L116 is so poorly preserved and possibly why we are unable to make any identifications in L144. The line would have cut across the area in the southern corner. We have been trying to correlate the northern and southern halves of the western half of the trench. If this line is true the two areas maybe entirely unassociated. If this is the case, L119 does not form a street with L116. On the other hand, L119 may lie within this line, and the disconnect between surface L122 and the wall may be a product of destructive erosion. In addition to the erosion line, a large pit (L139) cut through fill locus L140, which lies beneath L132 and 133 in the southern corner. I excavated the pit, which contained very little cultural material, and removed a few centimeters from L140 in order the mudbrick wall to the north of this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My next project was to directly work with the discernable mudbrick walls. There appear to be three new walls, which I combined together into L143. The bricks are all a golden color, and except for the eastern wall are a consistent size (about 40x24 cm). There are also 2 rows in each wall, except for the eastern wall. This east wall seems to have been disturbed by the debris in L142, and there is only 1 row visible. These walls join L116, which is the northern wall of a cell room. I removed the rest of the exposed portion of L116 since the wall is much better preserved below this. During the excavation, I discovered that L134 passes beneath this section of the wall. I donâ€™t think that this suggests a discontinutity between the lower and upper sections, so I did not assign a new locus for the lower part of the wall. Instead, I think that perhaps either the wall was repaired or modified after L134 was laid down. I then closed L116 because the entire wall now extends in an unbroken line. I made the entire wall L114. The western wall and part of the room interior room is cut by a small sealed pit L138, which contained ashy soil and very little cultural material. Since I have articulated the exterior of the walls, I began to excavate within the cell room (L137). At the beginning of the day, we accidentally discovered a large hole in the center of wall L116 within the room. We decided to excavate within the room to reach a level where we can better examine this feature (L146). The fill with in the room have very little cultural material, which is not surprising since rooms were generally swept out periodically. We did find pseudomorph residue, which may indicate grain storage. The traces were to ephemeral to trace. At the end of the day, we determined that L146 was a large pot, possibly a burial, and we will finish excavating it tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday I took a HAP from surface L134. I decided to excavate the entire area, expect for pit L127, north of L116 and 114. I took out the entire floor, which had a total volume of 196, which includes the 9 L HAP sample and a 3 L soil sample. The surface came off fairly easily, to expose the L145 subsurface. L145 is covered with larger stones and pebbles, some of which were removed during the excavation of L134. This suggest to me that there is another surface beneath this, but due to time constraints we will have to wait until next season to investigate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
