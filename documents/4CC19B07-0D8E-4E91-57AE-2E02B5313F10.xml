   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;08/05/2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Summary Journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Area C Trench 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench C2 was started in the 2000 season at Kenan Tepe and the excavation in trench continued in 2001. In 2001 the excavation was concentrated on dealing with a number of surfaces and their relation to the walls present in the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trench was prior to this season excavated to a depth between 596.56 and 595.97. That is roughly 2m below the topsoil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first problem that faced us, was the lay out of the trench, as it was done in 2000 with out the use of a total station, and therefore the trench was not laid out accordingly to the established grid, and because of the lack of precise measuring device the trench has a slightly crocked. All this were considered when we re-stringed the trench, where we stringed the actual trench and not the conceptual trench (the square that it should have been). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A note about the excavation technique, all the excavation in C2 this year was done with small pick and trowel, because I knew that we had to be careful because we would be searching for surfaces and mud brick architecture, things that will disappear when you are using the "buyuk kazma". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The south baulk was in a poor condition, because it had collapsed and cut back. Therefore it was cleaned and straightened on several occasions. The following loci were use in the process: L2127, L2129, L2137 and L2152.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The actual excavation started the 07/04/2002, where we started a locus L2103 in the western part of the trench. The purpose of this locus was to clean the dried dirt away, so that we would have a fresh surface to work from. The next couple of days went with cleaning the different areas of the trench, although this cleaning went on as we excavated different parts of the trench later in the season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On of the main structures in the trench was the wall foundation L2116, a foundation of stones, that had earlier supported a mud brick structure, that had removed during the last couple of seasons. The foundation wall L2116 stretched a long the north baulk and then turned south, almost to the south baulk. Abutting this wall L2116, was another foundation wall L2117, this wall was only one row of stones. L2117 abutted L2116 south end and ran towards the SE corner of the trench, where it hit the south baulk. Be fore the removal of both foundation walls, they had been cleaned (L2104 and L2105).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;L2116 was removed in sections, because it seemed to be resting on different areas. The south part of the wall L2116 was removed as L2108, as it was built on top of a surface identified in 2001, as L2099 (= L2145 this year). Among the stones removed in L2108, were there two basalt grinding stones (C.2.2108.1&amp;amp;6), which had been reused as building materials. The next part of the wall L2116, was removed as L2114, it was the last part of the north-south running part of the wall L2116. In this part the wall seemed to better built than in the part that was covered by L2108. While excavating L2114, we did not find any ground stone in the mix of stones that was L2116. The last part of the wall L2116, which almost ran parallel to the north baulk, was removed as L2119. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other wall L2117, was removed as L2120, where we found that southern end of this foundation wall L2117 was sloping and therefore had an extra course of stone. The wall it self had only one row of stones. With the two walls (L2116 and L2117) gone, we investigated the sub-wall fill. The fill L2121 under L2117 seemed to indicate that the wall was floating on dirt or fill. While the fill L2115 under the wall L2116, gave way to a mud brick wall L2143. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The area under L2115, L2119 and towards the west baulk was cleaned as L2122. Already we knew from previous excavations that there were two small pits L2123 and L2124, present here. But as we cleaned the area around these two small pits we saw lines radiating out from the two pits. These lines were what was left of trapezoid mud brick, forming circular patterns around the pits L2123 and L2124. This feature was labeled L2142. Along the northeastern edge of L2142 we encountered an area of soft darker dirt, this pit was labeled L2125. When it was excavated it consisted mostly of animal burrows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two small pits L2124 and L2123, in the center of L2142, were both capped by a hard plaster "lid" or top. The reason why they are mentioned together is that when they were excavated, every feature in one of them was reproduce in the other. They are both thermal pits, lined with potsherds, the dirt in them are heavily burnt. They are of same depth 22 cm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this feature, that consist of L2123, L2124 and L2142, plus maybe the wall L2143, function or meaning is, is still good question. The fact that the pits and mud brick seems to so well organized can indicate that the pits were not dug into the feature but rather a part of the construction. Function ? I can only guess, but since both pits had marks after burning, the function might have something to do with heating or fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The platform was excavated in vertical slices L2147 and L2154, which removed the mud brick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the eastern side of L2116 there was a large area where they last year excavated a large surface, pits and other disturbances. With the cleaning of this area, locus L2103, it was given a fresh start. Very early I could see that along the east baulk there was a disturbance L2106, this was separated from the rest of the area L2107. When we had excavated and cleaned the area that was L2106, it became clear that it was not one disturbance, but a number of features along the east baulk. Along the north part of the east baulk there was mud brick wall, L2134. Further south we had an area of light gray soil L2112.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we had excavated about 10cm of L2112, it became clear that there was two distinct different areas. The first of these L2128, was identified as a pit and a continuation of an earlier defined pit, which now dominates the south end of the east baulk. The other area L2118 was more interesting as it had a rusty-red soil color. L2118 functioned as a cleaning locus for this area. After cleaning it, it was divided into two, at time I thought distinct, loci L2141 and L2149. This was done because of a bright red-rusty line dividing two dark, ashy and moist areas. A thing to notice is that it took almost 4 days for this area, L2141/L2149 to dry. After excavation of the two loci, L2141 and L2149, and seeing that they had a bottom in common, they were equalized because of this. The bottom of these two loci, was excavated as L2160.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During one of cleanings of the south baulk, L2152, we removed some stones and found a feature, that looked like an oven feature, L2158, sitting in the baulk, in the south east corner of the trench. L2158 was extended towards the east baulk and continued downwards. It became clear that the features excavated as L2141, L2149, L2158 and L2160. Was in fact the same one, a thermal installation of some sort. The soil from L2158, in particular, had a high concentration of ash and charcoal. All four loci was sample for floatation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pit L2128, that was located almost next to the feature, just described, had sub division excavated as L2153. The fill in which L2128/L2153 was cut in to, was excavated first as L2132. In L2132 we saw mud brick coming out everywhere, especially along the north baulk, labeled L2133, but also single mud brick, apparently floating. This made me change locus to L2144. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This areas southern border was where the wall L2117 stood, it was removed as L2120 and the sub wall fill was labeled L2121. The wall L2117 was associated to a surface L2099, relabeled L2145, excavated last year on the south side of the wall, it was so that the surface, L2138/L2145 sloped up against the fill under the foundation wall L2121 and the foundation wall L2117.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The part of the surface L2145, that was under the wall L2116, removed as L2108, was cleaned as L2136. The surface was removed as L2146. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the surface L2145 we uncovered a mudbrick wall L2156, which ha d a preserved thin white plaster line on the south side. The wall L2156 runs from the southern end of the west baulk to the western end of the south baulk. The wall consists of 1.5 mudbrick, with the half being the plastered one. I put in a locus L2157 that would give a section of two the walls present in the trench, L2143 and L2156. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One good thing about the fill, dirt and other material excavated from the trench this year have had charcoal in them, so we should have a good opportunity to get some decent dating from some of the loci excavated. The pottery excavated has so far indicated that it is middle bronze age (MBA), circa 1800 BC, material we are digging. Though some of the potsherds, so far this is an unconfirmed rumor, from under the mudbrick platform (L2142), that is loci L2147 and L2154, might be earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The architecture excavated in the trench this season is mostly plain mudbrick or mudbrick-on-stone-foundation architecture, which unfortunately is not preserved in larger blocks, like shapes of rooms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again unfortunately there is a lot of lose ends in the trench. As we were ending the excavation in L2157 we came down upon some pebbles and potsherds, that to me looked like they could be lying on top of a surface, that might belong to the north side of the wall L2156. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With regard to L2153, we did seem to get to a clear bottom of that pit, so it will have to wait. As well will the wall L2143, as the stone foundation seems to better preserved than the mudbrick covering it, and therefore continues further south than the mudbrick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
