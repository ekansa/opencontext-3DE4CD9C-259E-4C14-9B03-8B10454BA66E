   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;FINAL TRENCH SUMMARY A-2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 22, 2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In preparation for excavations this season, we cut back the east and west baulks between the 5-13m pegs by 25cm each to prevent the walls from caving in on us. We also used the total station to lay in datum points every 4m on the east and west sides of the trench to facilitate elevations and to serve as fixed points to use as guide lines down the slope. We measured down to the bottom of the tepe; see above datum readings list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excavation in this trench was continued from where we left off last year (final locus number last year was 2042 and final KT number was 2311). The same two excavators, Ellie Moseman and Baris Uzel worked together again. Last year's pottery has been dated to Hellenistic, so we were interested in finding out what lies below the wall system we found last year. We had two main goals and one secondary goal for the season: define the walls we found at the end of last year between the south baulk and the 5m peg; press down in the second trench step between 5-10m pegs; move topsoil northwards down the slope. The following explanation of the trench this season will be broken into parts according to these three goal-areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;0-5m Step (48 new loci total)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began excavations in the southern part of the trench by removing the mini-step at the south baulk as L2051, 2052, and 2053. These three loci are mudbrick collapse tumbled from mudbrick wall L2056. This wall 2056 remains preserved in the west baulk with its plaster facing intact. We caught the plaster facing because it was evident in plan as a squiggly line running along the baulk as we began to excavate 2052 and 2053. We sunk a 50cm x 50cm probe (L2054) into the south edge of last year's L2042 (this year renamed as L2066) where we saw a plaster mortar line running on the north face of the wall; we were trying to find the base/foundations of 2066 and trace 2066 westward across the trench. This probe exposed rich occupational layers just below the surface. We unified the back end of the trench again as L2059 after 2051, 2052, and 2053 had reached the same elevation. We pressed down 2059 looking for the base of the plastered wall and the top layer seen in probe 2054; we hit an ash surface 2065 in the center of our narrow little trench. This hard packed charred surface had a permanent scoop pressed in for supporting the base of a pot. Around the perimeter of this charred surface, we found fragments of a plaster surface L2061. This plaster surface turns out to be the foundation for plaster wall L2056; the surface is bonded to the wall. We peeled back the remaining bits of wall 2066 and realized that 2066 is founded on the plaster surface (but 2066-2061 did not seem to be bonded together). We named the mudbrick wall that abuts (and is bonded to) 2066 on the north side as new locus 2067. We cut into 2067 to trace the plaster of 2061 northwards and saw that 2067 is also founded on surface 2061 (but again wall and surface do not appear to be bonded together). We lost the plaster surface as we moved northwards towards yet another wall: L2076. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shifting attention back to the charred surface L2065: having removed the wall L2066 we saw that some of the charred material runs underneath 2066; thus 2066 is later than this surface. We peeled off the char layer 2065 and found a circle of heavily burned cobblestones arranged directly underneath the position of the pot-rest lens. We named these cobbles as L2068. The stones were set in a hard packed red mudbrick-like unit with lots of charcoal bits speckled evenly throughout; we named this part L2062. We later decided that the cobbles plus the hard red charcoal-flecked material constitutes one entity: a hearth. Thus we renamed L2062 and L2068 as L2073 an excavated the hearth as though it were a pit. We troweled back from the edges of the cobbles to find the full dimensions of the hearth and discovered a small, shallow ash pit (L2069) at the south end of L2073. We then cut down into 2073 one half at a time to keep a section going in it. This hearth was constructed of two levels of cobbles with a thin (2-3cm) layer of soil between the layers. After removing the lower layer of cobbles, we were unsure if we had found the base of L2073, so we pressed down on half again. We eventually hit a single, much larger cobble indicating that we had something new (this new cobble will be mentioned again below as part of L2093). We eventually brought down all of 2073 to the elevation of this newly found cobble (2093).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the course of trying to define the extent of plaster surface L2061, we found another surface 2070. This hard packed pink earthen surface was preserved along the south baulk (and remains visible in section there). When we excavated this part of the trench we cut a lot of 2070 away before we realized what we had. The plaster line of 2061 is not preserved in the SE corner of the trench, although a small bit of the surface 2061 is traceable in the SW corner of the trench by looking at the baulk. An ash lens L2079 adjacent to the west baulk interrupts L2061, but we cannot be sure that it really cuts 2061 as a pit would, because the plaster is so fugitive everywhere else and the ash lens 2079 is so shallow (1cm at most) and ill-formed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Returning to the probe 2054 we saw that there was another red colored layer; this second one did not have charcoal inclusions like 2062 did. We peeled back the plaster surface 2061 including its greyish brown subsurface fill (this fill was excavated as 2061 because it was bonded to the plaster as a unit). Underneath 2061, the new red crumbly layer of soil L2063 extended out to cover the entire back end of the trench, except for where it was cut by hearth 2073 and charred surface 2065 on top of the hearth. Also, in the SE corner a roughly square-shaped area of bright yellow crumbly soil (L2072) interrupted L2063 red surface in such a way as to create a smooth seam. This yellow soil was almost the exact same thickness as L2063, so we excavated it as a surface, not as a pit. Also the smooth seam between 2072-2063 indicated that the red surface and the yellow surface were constructed contemporaneously; the red soil rounded down and the yellow scooped up to form a neat lip. Once 2063 was fully exposed, we saw that this red surface stops abruptly at the south edge of a mudbrick wall L2076. This abutment 2076-2063 is preserved in both east and west baulks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We peeled off 2063 to expose the subsurface fill L2078, from which we were eager to collect pottery sherds given the good seal that 2063 offered. We excavated 2078 in parts, leaving an artificial baulk between the hearth 2073 and 2078 around it so that we would not mix contexts. In the SE corner corresponding to the spot underneath L2072, we realized that we had a mudbrick wall (2084) with distinct brick lines in plan and in section. This wall remains pedestaled; we did not fully excavate it this season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We closed L2078 when we had brought the entire area (under where 2063 had been) down to the level of the first new cobble we had found that makes up L2093. This locus (2093) is a ring of colorful river stones placed slightly to the side of the base of hearth 2073. Therefore we can say that 2093 and 2073 are distinct entities, although 2073 may be a later hearth placed at a similar location. The beaten earth surface that corresponds to 2093 became L2081; this surface had a little bit of plaster preserved at the west baulk but this has been trampled away now. This surface is cut by an ash pit (L2091) in the SW corner; the pit contained some sherds that we lifted from the surface as well as a broken grindstone that remains in situ (it just barely peeks out of the pit soil at this point).  Besides the pit 2091 there are three interesting features visible in/cutting surface 2081. An oval shaped crusty orange-ish object (L2094) is peeking out underneath the edge of wall L2084 at the south baulk. We think 2094 may be an oven or possibly some strange kind of brick mortar. Just to the south of 2094 is the ring of cobbles 2093 which may be a hearth. Just to the east of the cobbles and adjacent to the east baulk is a circular shaped ring of pottery sherds (L2090) which may be either a potsmash or a pot that was dropped or a pot that was thrown down or a pot that fell off the table and did not break immediately but was later stomped upon or a pot that was...you get the picture... If this ring of orange material 2090 is not a potsmash, it could be another little oven. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the three features and a pit found in the surface L2081, we also found three new walls (for which the trench is semi-famous...the trench of never ending walls). Mudbrick wall L2089 runs north-south starting just north of the potsmash 2090 and following the east baulk to where it abuts another mudbrick wall L2087. This wall 2087 runs east-west and we think we have found the end of it because one brick runs into the baulk, a second large pinkish brown brick is fully visible, and the last brick is a crumbly yellow facing brick which is slightly wider that the body brick faces. No bricks extend westward past this yellow brick. To the north of 2087, another mudbrick wall 2088 is visible. This wall is made of large body bricks that have distinct, sharp mortar lines in plan (I love this wall). We peeled off the top two courses of the wall 2076 to the north of L2088 in order to see if they abut or are founded one on top of another. With these two walls flattened at the same elevation, we see that they abut in a clean line. All of these new walls, as well as L2076 remain in situ; we did not fully excavate them this season. In order to find the foundations and width of wall 2076 we did, however, sink a probe 2071 into wall 2076 at the west baulk (in order to try to find brick lines in section). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second area of focus within the 0-5m step is the place between the front of wall 2076 and the 5m peg where we found a pit 2014 and an oven 2015 last year. We renamed pit 2014 as 2044 and excavated it. While excavating the fill 2057 east of pit 2044 we hit more ash. This ash turned out to be another pit 2058, at the base of which we found a nice toy wheel / spindle whorl. We named the context cut by pit 2058 as 2080 and pressed down. We found another pit 2082 which cut 2080 at the east baulk several cm underneath last year's oven 2015. We also identified an area of mudbrick collapse 2083 resulting from wall 2076-tumble. To the west of 2080, we excavated the context cut by pit 2044 as L2074; 2074 started out as an extension of probe L2071. We saw in the 5m section cut two ash lines which we considered to be the base of 2074. While trying to trace these ash lines we found an impression of a straw / reed basket L2085. This basket impression rests on surface 2092 (we changed L2080 and L2074 to L2092 when we found the impression and isolated the impression as its own locus). We removed the basket impression by creating a casing of plaster and lifted the whole section of soil out of the trench for conservation. This extraction left an artificial pit which allowed us to see the more of the ash lines we had seen earlier in the 5m section cut. We peeled off L2092 to the top of the ash on both sides of the "basket pit" and flattened the pedestal 2105 left behind after removal of the plaster cast-basket. The ash surface is named 2102 in the east and 2103 in the east (they are equal). The ash abuts some entity that we later identified as L2110--a possible new mudbrick wall at the east baulk. The ash 2102 is cut by a large animal burrow L2104. Underneath ash surface 2102+2103 we found a plaster surface 2106 in the east and a mudbrick pavement 2107 in the west. The plaster of 2106 scoops up at the south and east sides, indicating that it is bonded to wall L2076 and the potential wall 2110. Thus these two walls and surface 2106 make a corner. We consider these to be equal also because of the small space they occupy. We excavated L2106 to expose the subsurface fill 2111 below it. Subsurface fill 2111 is cut by an ash entity / pit 2108 which contained some plaster in the top most portion, suggesting that there is some continuity with 2106 here. We excavated 2107 to expose the cobblestone wall foundations 2109 below it. The cobblestones of 2109 at the west baulk lead us to the second area of excavation in A-2 this season: the 5-10m step. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5-10m Step (18 new loci total)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the 5m peg, we excavated L2075 as mudbrick collapse. This locus contained some large cobblestones L2077. When we were excavating the basket impression 2085, we removed these stones, but actually they are part of the same wall-foundation as 2109. We pressed down the step at the 6-7m peg as L2086. We saw mudbrick bands alternating pink and grey-green in the north cut at the 7m peg, but as we excavated 2086, we could never find brick lines in plan, nor in section. We also pressed down the 1m x 2m area at the 7-8m peg as L2045; this locus is fill above a series of surfaces. The first surface under 2045 is L2047+2048 which we recognized as a surface by the potsmash 2046 located at the east baulk on 2047. We removed this surface and found more flat lying sherds and charcoal bits on surface 2049. We brought L2075 and L2086 down to the same elevation as L2049 at which point we saw ash at the east baulk. We named this ashy area L2095 and excavated it as a pit; it turned out to be fugitive ash lenses that were difficult to define and spread out all over the east half of the step and into the west half. We named the soil the ash lenses rested upon/cut 2096. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Together with 2095, 2096 constitutes a layer of ash-filled occupational debris above a surface 2100. We recognized a new surface because the east baulk showed a sharp transition from ash to red soil and we found a flat-lying grindstone / doorpost at the 8m peg. We decided to treat one persistent ash lens as a pit L2099 at the east baulk adjacent to where we found the flat lying doorpost/grindstone resting on 2100. We pressed down 2100 and changed to L2101, subsurface fill. One small area of L2100 remains pedestalled at the end of the season: at the west baulk and the 8m peg. This part of the step showed brick lines in section but we were unable to find brick lines in plan nor by cutting into the soil from the east. We still are not sure if there is a wall here or not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The narrow step at the 8m peg was excavated as L2064 subtopsoil. This is where we saw brick lines of L2100-west pedestaled portion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another narrow step at the 8.5m peg was excavated as L2050 subtopsoil. As we cut this step we exposed a wide band of black ashy soil at the west baulk; we peeled back L2064 to identify the ash; it appears to be charred mudbrick and next year's excavators should treat it as its own thing. We also saw brick lines in plan once we exposed the top of the ash area on the 2064 step. These bricks should correspond with whatever entity is pedestalled in 2100. We could not successfully identify the features at this 8m peg, which frustrated us. Maybe next year's excavations can answer some of the questions we merely raised this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Between the 10m - 11m pegs, we pressed down as fill layer L2060. At the base of this step we saw two lines of cobbles. We peeled back the soil in the 9-10m step as L2060 to come down on top of the cobble layers. Just above the cobbles, we hit harder soil and changed locus to L2097. We removed 2097 to expose a pebble surface 2098 that extends between the 9m peg to the 10m peg and may continue into the step left over at the 9m cut (below 2050).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;10-25m Steps (4 new loci total)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the 12m peg we cut topsoil 2043 down step by step down to the 25m peg. We also dug some subtopsoil 2064 at the 16m, 17m, and 19m peg. We found one interesting feature L2055 at the 13m peg: a row of large cobbles ending at the east with a huge flagstone. We believe this may be the remnants of a wall foundation or maybe a burial. The stones remain in situ; we did not remove 2055 this season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end we did not complete as much of the second trench step as we had hoped we would. We think next year's excavators should still try to press down in the 0-5m step to get more of the good contexts showing up there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
