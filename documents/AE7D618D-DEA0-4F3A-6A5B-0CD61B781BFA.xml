      <arch:string>At the end of each week, trench supervisors were expected to write a concise summary of the previous week’s activities.  The purpose of this weekly summary was to review the week’s notes, check for completeness, identify any mistakes or missing information, and to begin building interpretations.</arch:string>

      <arch:string type="xhtml">&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Journal / Summary:A-6-2001-Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 4, 2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Week 5 Summary; Area 6 Final Statement Part 1(Andrew Ugan)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Like Area 7, Area 6 has only been excavated for a week. In that time, an 8x2m trench was opened up continuing east from the L4008 spur of A4. Unlike other trenches in the area A, this one was relatively shallow (25-50cm below ground surface) owing to time constraints and the presence of rock architecture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	In the end, Area 6 produced three distinct rock alignments. Two of these, L6006 and L6001, appear to be walls or foundations. Given the way that L6006 turns in the trench, it looks as if they may form a continuous structure of which part remains buried in the north sidewall. Another locus was also assigned to the fill bordered by these two features (L6005), although none of it was removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	L6001 and L6006 are also similar in composition. While both contain a number of river-rolled cobbles and flagstones, they also have two or more large, rectilinear boulders of white or greyish white stone. L6006 also has at least three boulders which have gouged furrows or cross-hatching on them. They may be quarry marks, though this is pure supposition on my part. These rocks also appear to be somewhat softer than the other large stones in either feature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The third rock alignment was an east-west trending line of stones which branched off of L6006 (L6002). Although these two features abut, L6002 sits higher than L6006 (has a higher level of origin). By the end of the week, the single exposed course of L6002 had been removed, while L6002 remained. The exact nature/function of this feature is unknown, but there were two points of interest. One was the presence of several large pieces of weak sandstone or conglomerate in the center of the line. The second is a burial which was located immediately below the three large stones at the east end of the feature (L6004). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Both this burial and burial L6007 occur in the floor of the trench at a relatively shallow depth below ground surface and may be quite late. The orientation of either is somewhat nebulous, but L6007 at least appears as if it might be laid out facing north-south. Like burial L7002, this would make it an oddity, especially since all the other near surface burials are aligned east-west. The proximity of each of these to other nearby features (particularly L6004) holds some promise for sorting out a sequence of internment. Because they occur at such shallow depths, there is also the possibility that other burials exist in the same area. Since the east edge of the site occurs only a short distance from the end of the trench, little room exists for additional burials or other features in that direction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Summary Part 2 (Amy Stevens)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aug. 20, 2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Work was started again in trench A6 on Aug. 12, 2001. Work was done on two loci: L6007 and L6001. There had originally been excitement about L6007 because it had a bone appearing to be a humerus which seemed to lie north-south. This would make its direction different from the other burials excavated in the A trenches this season. This burial turned out to be a pile of bones, with not all bones present. So it was a different burial in that it was possibly a secondary burial although most bones were missing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	L6001 was of very special interest because rather than being a wall it turned out to be a cist tomb. We're assuming that the cist burial was dug into a pit because the soil directly above it was a different color than the soil surrounding it.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The fact that it was a cist tomb definitely made it different from the other burials in that it was the first burial from this and last season with an actual tomb. Also, according to our compass grid it was lying with the head on the southwest side unlike 5 out of the 6 tombs I excavated this season which had the head on the west side. There was one (Trench A3 L3002) with the head on the southwest side but it had no tomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	An interesting note about the burial L6010 (inside of L6001) was that the upper half of the skeleton (all bones superior to the pelvic girdle) was still articulated but the bottom half of the skeleton, including the left forearm, had been laid in a pile at the foot of the tomb and there was a large rock cutting half the width of the tomb, separating the head and foot of the tomb. The bones laid at the bottom were in very good condition in that they were mostly whole and had few fractures and breaks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The fact that there are piled bones at the foot of the grave raises the question as to whether this was a secondary burial. My opinion is that it was not because the upper half of the skeleton is all in place, still articulated, and very good condition, suggesting it was placed there when the person died and has been undisturbed. The vertebrae, for example, were in better shape than any of the burials I've seen this season. Possibly the bones were moved some time after the interment of the body took place. The best explanation I can think of for the placement of the lower bones is the possibility that the tomb was robbed, and some of the bones were disturbed and then moved to a pile afterwards.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	We found no grave goods in this tomb. It is somewhat common to find grave goods in cist tombs from the Roman Period and Early Bronze Age.  We can assume that this burial is not from either of these periods considering that its stratigraphic level is too high to be Bronze Age and Roman cist tombs were typically cut into rock rather than dug in pits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	A final note about this burial is that we were in a hurry to find out whether or not there was a body within the rocks when we took the top rock off. While digging in the soil under the top rock we put a very minor gouge in the skeleton's face. We weren't concentrating on watching for differences in the soil as we dug down but did notice the dirt inside was softer than outside of the tomb. The face of the skeleton was only a few centimeters under the layer of dirt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	These two burials, L6010 and L6007, were on opposing sides of the trench, approximately 2 meters apart. It is interesting to note that there was only a centimeter difference between the elevation on top of the bones of L6007 and the top of the rocks of the tomb L6001.  Since there is no direct stratigraphic association documented between these two features we can only speculate whether or not there was a time period relationship between when these two burials were dug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The side walls of the tomb, L6010, still remain, we only removed rocks overlying the side wall. The tomb is obviously empty now with the lowest elevation being 99.78. I dug a little deeper in the tomb after the skeleton had been excavated to verify there were no bones that had been missed. There is a small pit where L6007 was, with its lowest elevation being 99.95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	There are two more loci, L6006 and L4013(In trench A4 from which A6 extends) which are rock features resembling the structure and direction of L6001 and thus suspected to be additional cist tombs. Due to lack of time we couldn't excavate either of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
