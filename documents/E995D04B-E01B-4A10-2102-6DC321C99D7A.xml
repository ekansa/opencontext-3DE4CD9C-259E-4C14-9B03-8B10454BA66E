      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weekly Summary 6--Week ending 08/18/2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Sense did finally come to the trench this week, and it came in spades. The short version is that for the last two weeks we've mostly been digging through between-phase material, and now we've come down on not only one, but two earlier phases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The upper phase is defined from surface L5066, which appeared in the center of the trench below L5054. The surface was home to many flat-lying sherds, including a number of the black on white painted sherds and maybe a partially restorable large storage jar. Its northern wall was found, though only a small portion coming less than a meter out of the baulk before it got cut, possibly by a pit. The wall's northern face, was, however, plaster-lined. Some scattered remnants of a plaster floor were uncovered. The proper context for SW oven L5029 was also found in this surface, and can be traced along the section, via L5065/5055 to the surface, which is important, as otherwise the oven's black on white sherds (and those from the two latter loci) could be interpreted improperly. The surface was not fully uncovered, as time constraints in the last week of digging prevented proper excavation, especially in lieu of the other, earlier phase uncovered...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	SW-NE mudbrick wall L5045's full context has now been discovered. It is, in fact, part of a two room (within the trench) structure on a NW-SE orientation, bounded on the north by walls L5045 (at least a portion of which is plaster-lined) and L5074 and continuing into both the western and eastern baulks. The original SW-NE segment of the wall actually separates the two rooms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The eastern room, which is also bounded by wall L5061 on the south, has a softly packed earthen floor (L5063) and an oven or hearth, apparently built directly into the NW-SE portion of wall L5045 and bulging to N to form the structure's northern wall in that segment. Grain-rich soil samples (KT 5402 and 5384) and a few carbon samples, which can hopefully tie a date to the structure, were taken from the oven. Cutting into the circle of the oven on the south and leading me to believe it is, in fact, a hearth is a lowered, circular area was found in front of the hearth, with a very thin layer of fibrous ashes at the bottom. The sunken area is also the only context within the house area that has produced a significant amount of pottery. A sounding (L5070) was dug in the NW corner of the room to confirm the surface, which it did, and attempt to find how deep the walls were founded, which seems to be about 12 cm below the surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The west room, which was discovered later as oven L5029 and the upper surface significantly cut into its distinguishing walls and possibly part of its plaster floor (L5068) in the far SW, has a plaster floor (or series thereof), L5068, above a very hard (think concrete) earth floor, L5069.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	On the N of the building, a group of three fishnet weights (KT 5468, 5469, 5470) was uncovered at a level similar in elevation to the interior surface levels. To the west of them, a stone jumble was uncovered with some areas of ash (L5076) which may be some sort of hearth built up against the wall or which may just be unclear as all the stones have yet to be uncovered (and won't be until next season). Finally, a small, circular burnt mudbrick feature was discovered (L5072) which had some burnt cereals in its vicinity. The latter looks like some sort of oven associated with the house, but there was not time in the week (season) to dig it fully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The trench was cleaned for a spider shot of the features as they stand at the end of the season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p/&gt;
