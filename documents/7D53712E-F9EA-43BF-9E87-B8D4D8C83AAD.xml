   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Trench Summary 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Area F, Trench 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 2, 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;C.Painter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Area F is located in the "lower town" area of the site due east of the main mound. Within this area, trench 7 is located north of trench F9 and west of trench F2, with this overall clustering of trenches lying approximately 10 meters north of trenches F1 and F4.. F7 measures 9.3 x 9.8 meters and was roughly 1.5 meters deep when I began excavation. The F1 datum point (570.64) was used for the entirety of the season for all elevations. The trench had been previously excavated in three different seasons (2001, 2002, 2004), therefore the goals for this season were to remove any loci that were left open from the 2004 season and to excavate down and expose more Late Chalcolithic/EBA architecture that was initially reached last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before work began in earnest, it was necessary to locate, renumber, and excavate key loci from the 2004 season. These loci included a rectangular pebble surface located in the southeast corner of the trench that was not given a locus number last season (new locus 7138), an oval trampled pebble surface located in the center of the trench (old locus 7134, new locus 7141), and a stone feature with two parallel lines of 10-20cm cobbles in the southwest corner of the trench (old locus 7133, new locus 7140). Two pits (7103 and 7127) that were excavated in 2004 were also still present at the start of this season, therefore these features, along with several uneven fill areas in the northwest corner of the trench (7131 and 7121/7135) where the primary focus of leveling activities that were initially undertaken once the renumbering of loci was completed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to the size of the trench, it was decided to subdivide the trench into four quadrants in order to have better control over the excavation of areas, especially when new features were to arise. The southwest quadrant of the trench was assigned locus 7139 and encompassed loci 7128 and 7129 from the 2004 season. The northwest quadrant was assigned locus 7142 and encompassed fill loci 7131 and 7121/7135 and pit 7127. The northeast quadrant of the trench was assigned as locus 7145 and encompassed old loci 7103 (pit), 7122 (fill), 7126 (fill), 7132 (fill), 7136 (pit), and 7137 (pit). Finally, the southeast quadrant of the trench was assigned as locus 7149 and encompassed old fill locus 7126. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the process of leveling the entire trench by a combination of big and small picking, a small circular pit surrounded by a ring of ash (old locus 7137, new locus 7143) was excavated with trowels along with another small pit (7144) that was composed of heavily compacted burnt pot sherds. This latter pit had been cut by the excavation of locus 7103 from last season, so it is impossible to know the exact dimensions of this pit. What is clear is that this pit and associated sherd cluster is most likely related to locus 7147, a circular ashen surface with a 12cm diameter pit or divot off center that was found directly below 7144. Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Excavation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work in F7 this season revealed a number of important features that can be divided into four groups: burials, walls, surfaces, and pits. These groups will be discussed separately and interpretation given to how these features interrelate with one another in both space and time (i.e. stratigraphically).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Burials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A total of four burials were excavated this season, surprisingly each one coming from a different quadrant of the trench. In each case, metal dental picks and medium-stiffness small brushes were used in articulation and excavation taking great care not to scratch the surface of the bones. Individual parts of the body (i.e. left arm, right collar bone) were collected and identified separately as best as possible given the circumstances of preservation of the bones. In two cases (7150 and 7200), disarticulation of the burial and poor preservation of the bones led to a less-than-adequate excavation of the burial whereby only a small number of bones were identifiable and the rest were included within a "miscellaneous bones" foil package. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For all burials a screening ratio of 1:1 was employed and a 1mm sieve was used. Any cultural materials that were recovered directly from the burial or within the sieve were combined into a single pottery KT, lithic KT, etc. for that specific locus. In general, very little cultural material was found within any of the burials and overall included small diagnostic and mostly non-diagnostic sherds, separate animal bone, almost no lithics, and carbon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first burial (7148) that was excavated was located in the northwest corner of the trench cutting fill loci 7142 and 7155. The primary burial (KT3) was that of an adult individual in an extended position on his/her back with head on the eastern side of the locus facing north and the body going west toward the west baulk. Only half of the body was present/preserved from the base of the rib cage to the skull. Below the rib cage, aggressive scraping totaling in a 15-20 cm deep cut was performed in order to trace the lower extremities of the body in case, either due to erosional factors or primary positioning of the body, the leg and pelvic bones were laying at an increasingly sharp angle to the rest of the body. This turned out to not be the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on what remains, the individual seems to have been buried in an extended position on his/her back with both arms bent at the elbows and hands resting on the collarbone and upper sternum. The arms were not crossed over the chest but instead bent directly up to the head with the right hand resting on the right collar bone, etc. and the left resting on the left side (Note: "left" and "right" are from the point of view of the observer and not the buried individual). It should be noted that preservation of the arm in this position was present only on the right side. In the absence of the arm on the left side, this bent arm position is evident by preservation of the finger and wrist bones resting on the left collarbone, rib cage, etc. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was also observed that the skull and portions of the shoulder and collarbone were resting on a burn layer and/or surface which possibly extended to include the entire body resting on this surface that could have been cut during excavation. This burn layer is also visible in the north section profile of this locus. Interestingly none of the skeletal material was burnt, suggesting that this burial was a later addition to an already present surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second burial (7150) was located along the southern edge and within fill L7145 and cutting mud brick wall 7160 (see below). This burial proved to be extremely disturbed/damaged and was essentially divided into two parts: a northern grouping of fragmentary unidentifiable bones most probably scattered by hand pick excavation in this area (thus nothing was found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and a southern grouping which had an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cluster of long bones (arms?), fingers, and a fragmentary shoulder blade. All skeletal material was included within a single KT(2).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The long bones were found tightly packed together along with ribs suggesting a crouched or flexed positioning of the body. Exact orientation or sex/age of the individual however was unavailable. The long bone cluster was found cutting the northern edge of wall 7160 and resting on what appears to be a white lime or mud plastered surface which is extremely fragmentary. It could also have been mortar between courses for the mud brick wall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Between burials 7148 and 7150 there is an elevation difference of 20cm for the upper levels and 30cm for the basal levels. In general, this difference is not too significant, however in light of the fact that there are no surfaces or walls or other features that directly connect the two burials in spatial respects, it would be extremely difficult to say without doubt that the two burials are related in time. Furthermore the relative lack of pottery within each of the burial pits makes stratigraphic relationships between these loci even more difficult. However the fact that these burials are distinctly associated with separate surfaces and/or walls in their own right will be important for tying these burials with larger features within the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The third burial (7200) was excavated later in the season in the southwest quadrant of the trench where it was found below fill 7173, cutting fill 7207 and directly abutting pit 7199 on the northern side of the burial. The burial contained the skeleton of a single individual, most probably a small child based on the size of the body and the development of the teeth. The burial was set inside an ovoid pit that was lined on the north, east, and south sides by a single course of mud bricks (three unburnt bricks total), whose level of preservation was medium to poor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Articulation of the body was especially difficult as the bones would flake and/or disintegrate upon light brushing. What was determined was that the burial contained a skull with intact teeth, part of the spinal column vertebrae, and what is perhaps the rib bones. The lower section of the individual was either not interned or was not preserved. The teeth were collected in a separate foil envelope. The rest of the bones were in such a fragmentary state that they were lumped into a "miscellaneous bones" envelope. Both bone bags were labeled under one KT (KT1). Additionally one of the three mud bricks which were found to line the pit was taken for a flotation sample. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last, the fourth burial (7221) was discovered at the very end of the season inside a mud brick feature (7183) located in the southeast corner of the trench that had initially been designated as a solid platform. Only from later examination was this platform found to contain a rectangular pit that was cutting the center of the mud brick feature and contained a human burial at its basal levels. At this point, the burial was emerging from the eastern baulk, therefore it was decided to excavate a portion of the eastern baulk which separates trench F7 from F2 in order to excavate the entirety of the burial. This was accomplished with large pick axes where a section 35cm to the north and south of platform 7183 was removed down to roughly 5cm above the top level of pit 7221. From here, hand trowels were used to come down on top of the burial at which point finer articulation with dental picks and brushes was performed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The burial itself was composed of an adult male, based on the size of the pelvis, in a flexed position on the left side running in an east-west orientation (Note: "left" and "right" orientation is based on the point of view of the buried individual and not of the excavator/observer as for burial 7148). The right leg and foot were resting on top of the left leg and foot. The right arm was resting on the left forearm. The left hand was found near the skull which faced to the south. Some pottery sherds were recovered near the body but no obvious grave goods. A carbon sample was recovered from the fill just above the hands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upon excavation of the burial, it was determined that the pit did not actually cut the mud bricks, but instead the bricks appeared to have been lining this burial. This does not disregard the fact that feature 7183 could have been initially used for other purposes and only later was a burial placed inside of it. However, this earlier function is not entirely clear as evidence for burning or fire (characteristics that might equate with an oven) apart from some residual ash and fire-cracked pebbles were not present inside the feature, nor were any other cultural materials or distinguishing characteristics of the mud brick feature itself conducive to functional interpretation other than use in this burial. The presence of thoroughly burnt mud bricks on both the western and eastern side of 7183 (locus 2029 in trench F2) suggest however that some kind of firing incident/activity did occur here at some point, but only on the upper course of brick as the lower two courses were completely unburned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Walls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several mud brick walls were excavated this season throughout all quadrants of the trench. In most cases, the walls were composed of only a single course of bricks (exceptions do occur, see below) with anywhere from 7-15 rows depending on the length of the entire feature. No stone foundations were uncovered that could be directly associated with any wall, though as will be discussed below, a pebble surface and three to four larger cobbles (7159) found running below wall 7159 might be considered foundational elements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The initial walls to be uncovered were that of 7158 and 7160, located in the southeast quadrant of the trench. It was originally thought that locus 7157 was a third wall running in a east-west direction connected with the southern end of 7158. This assessment was later found to be false and 7157 was changed to a fill locus. 7158 was a two course mud brick wall with seven to eight rows running in a north-south direction which terminated in the south at 30-40 cm "foundational" stones. The top most course of brick was extremely thin and upon its removal, was found to be resting on a second course of bricks that appeared to be burnt on top. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;7160 was a one to two, possibly three, course mud brick wall with relatively shallow depth (thickness) and eight to nine rows of brick. It was initially unclear whether 7160 met 7158 at a corner, however it may be safely assumed that this was the case. The possibility for a doorway in this area as opposed to a corner is unlikely based on the fact that the western end of wall 7160 was found to be associated with a door socket from fill 7152 (KT4) and trampled pebble surface 7169. Unfortunately this surface was not discovered throughout the rest of the "inside context" fill locus 7156 which either means it was missed, the surface was not well preserved in this fill area, or 7156 was never an "inside context" at all but instead an outside, unpaved area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once this "structure" composed of walls 7158, 7160 and surface 7169 was removed (including subwall fill 7175, 7176 and subsurface fill 7171 respectively), another series of mud brick walls were uncovered almost immediately. This serves as a direct reflection of multiple building phases within this southeast quadrant of the trench. The new walls can be considered definitely as a "structure" since they are all interconnecting, in most cases at right angles. In this respect, a single locus was assigned (7178) and encompassed a total of four wall extensions (labeled A through D on the June 13, 2005 day plan) that formed a set of twin "magazine-type" rooms in the center of the eastern half of the trench. The orientation of this building varies from that of walls 7158 and 7160. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The exact function of this building (whether domestic, commercial, or storage) cannot be determined with certainty based on the "clean" fill loci (7177, 7179, 7180) that were excavated and lack of any surfaces within the rooms. The suggestion of storage purposes is offered based on the relative narrowness of the rooms (roughly a meter in both cases) and the lack of any permanent installations such as hearths, smelting areas, or other domestic and/or commercial features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though a difference of ten to fifteen centimeters can be seen in elevations between 7178 and adjacent wall stub 7187, platform 7183, and plaster-lined bin 7186 it can be hypothesized that all these mud brick features are associated stratigraphically to encompass some type of small-scale building complex within the eastern half of the trench composed of a series of inside storage-sized rooms and outside workspaces in fill 7177 and 7173. As will be discussed below, this can also include pit 7181 whose topmost elevations which were taken from a compacted mud layer sealing the pit and roughly equal to that of the surrounding wall features. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The same associations, at least based on elevations, can be drawn with a complex of walls and surfaces discovered in the northwest corner of the trench and excavated over several weeks. The mud brick walls included 7154 and 7163, both composed of a single course with a range from eight to ten rows of brick. In the case of 7163, a core of reddish brown bricks were flanked on the northern and western sides by a single even course of white brick. On the bottom, the wall was found to be resting on a burnt layer that was visible inside the west section for pit 7162 (see below). Clear brick lines were visible for 7163 in which a white or grayish mortar was employed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike building 7178, which showed no signs of burning or destruction, both 7154 and 7163 were sealed by a thick debris layer (7153, 7161, 7164) that was visible within the north baulk section directly connecting the tops of 7154 and 7163. These layers of debris included heavy ash, mud brick slump, and in some cases (7161) whole mud bricks that had been heavily burnt. Fortunately this destruction aided the preservation of several superimposed floors that lay beneath (to be discussed below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Returning now to building 7178, only one more wall was uncovered directly below the subwall fill (7195) as evidence for a third rebuilding phase. This wall (7210) was oriented in an east-west direction parallel with pit 7181 and was composed of coarse-textured brick with pebble inclusions. This wall was found to be associated only with one other feature- a poorly-preserved trampled pebble surface (7208) that abutted 7210 on its northern and northwestern face. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly a series of walls which can loosely be associated through elevational similarities are 7201 located in the southwest corner of the trench abutting fill 7204 and 7207, wall 7202 in the northwest corner of the trench cut by pit 7162 on its eastern side and associated with surface 7220 on its northern face, long wall 7209 that bends at a corner on its northern end, and short wall stub 7212 located in the northeast quadrant of the trench that was found to abut plaster surface 7219 on its southern face. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately the great distances between these unconnecting walls makes interpretation of their function within the greater area of the trench difficult. Based on the presence of floor 7219, this area maybe considered an "inside" context involving walls 7209 and 7212. The abutting of floor 7220 with 7202 also draws attention to the fact that this wall may be involved with a building context. Information regarding features associated with wall 7201 however is severely lacking, unless one considers that based on elevational similarities, burial 7200 and pit 7199 (to be discussed below) are stratigraphically linked, though not directly abutting one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Surfaces/floors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortunately this season revealed a plethora of floors and surfaces within the trench and many were found to either be abutting or bonded to mud brick walls. In most cases, the Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP) was enabled for excavation of these surfaces and included a selected 50 x 50cm HAP sample area that was recovered &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;in toto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; along with measurement in liter-marked buckets of the remainder of the surface and collection of a soil sample if possible (Note: in some cases this season a floatation sample was not able to be collected because the mud plastering of the surface did not allow for any loose soil matrix). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall these loci can be divided into two categories: trampled/compacted pebble surfaces and compacted mud/mud plastered floors. The first group included surface 7159 that, as discussed above, was found to run below wall 7158 in the southeast quadrant of the trench. Though not directly abutting, this compacted pebble surface can be confidently associated with surface 7166 that was excavated using the HAP within fill locus 7156. In either case, the amount of cultural material pressed into these surfaces was minimal and included mostly broken pot sherds. Unfortunately these surfaces were not found to be bonded or abutting walls 7158 or 7160 which are in the direct vicinity. It is most probably the case that these surfaces and walls are not stratigraphically linked in that the surfaces are from an later occupation of the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another trampled pebble surface that was discussed earlier is 7169, which was found to be abutting (it is not entirely clear whether or not the surface was bonded) wall 7160. 7169 was also noted to be directly abutting a door socket from fill 7152 located directly north of 7160. Interestingly, a second door socket was found below and slightly east of the topmost socket within the same fill locus (7152) suggesting multiple building phases not necessarily for the mud brick walls, but perhaps associated with the rebuilding of floors within this same structure. Unfortunately a second trampled surface below 7169 was not detected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A final pebbled surface that was excavated using the HAP was 7208 located north of wall 7209 and northwest of wall 7210. Though overall this surface was not well preserved, areas that showed clear compaction of pebbles and small pot sherds were found to be abutting both walls 7209 and 7210 on their northern faces. This draws into sharp relief the possibility that walls 7209 and 7210 are in fact associated, with perhaps wall 7212 added to this structure as a later addition. These three walls in particular with associated surfaces will need to be worked out in detail stratigraphically in the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A last comment on surface 7208 is its possible association with mud plastered floor 7213 which was uncovered adjacent to 7208 on its eastern side, but at a lower elevation. Therefore the interpretation here is that either surface 7208 at one time extended east to cover floor 7213 and was simply not preserved or the two surfaces/floors coexisted and represent perhaps inside and outside contexts to the same building phase. If this latter hypothesis is the case, then plastered floor 7219 must also be included within this phase as will be discussed below, 7213 and 7219 can be loosely considered equal or at least associated based on color, texture, construction, and elevation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second group of floors that were excavated this season and encompass the larger number of surfaces found were either compacted mud or mud plaster floors. The most notable of these came from the northwest corner of the trench associated with walls 7154 and 7163 where two series of superimposed plaster floors (7170/7182/7185/7189/7194 and 7168/7174) were each individually excavated using the HAP. For continuity, an effort was made to draw the HAP sample from the same general area for each floor. Floors 7168 and 7174 located on the western side of wall 7163 were found to be bonded with that wall as was evident at the time of excavation and in the north baulk section. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the floors between walls 7163 and 7154, 7170 and 7182 showed the clearest evidence for bonding with wall 7163 at the time of excavation, however after the removal of the rest of the floors an almost rainbow of different colored surfaces were visible in the eastern section of 7163 suggesting a definite association between the floors and the wall. As for wall 7154, the associations are less clear due to heavy burning and disturbance on all floors along the western face of this wall. The wall itself along with these surfaces also suffered the disturbance of being cut by later pit 7162 (to be discussed below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though a number of distinct floors were able to be distinguished and excavated, work in this area brought to light the reality that many more surfaces were located here and tightly superimposed. These additional surfaces were visible only in the cross-sections of pieces of plaster floor which were noted and photographed at the time of excavation. The fact that each one of these surfaces was only millimeters in thickness made their individual detection and excavation extremely difficult if not impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last mud plastered floors that will be discussed in detail are 7213 and 7219 each located in the eastern half of the trench. The defining feature for 7213 was the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; door socket that had been sunk into the plaster of the surface. Unfortunately this socket did not line up with wall 7210, nor was this floor abutting that wall locus so it may be assumed that 7210 was associated with surface 7208 and therefore wall 7209 but not floors 7213 and 7219. 7219 was also found to contain an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;in situ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;door socket that had been sunk into the plaster. In this case, the floor on the eastern side of the locus actually rose in elevation to meet the socket and therefore the doorway of the structure. As with 7213 however, a direct link between the door socket and any wall was not uncovered, unless one considers the new mud brick walls that were beginning to emerge on the last day of the season and were therefore left unexcavated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most interesting feature of floor 7219 was the sunken plastered pit that showed the greatest evidence for burning. Discovered laying directly on top of the floor due south of this pit was a heavily burnt pedestal base for a pedestalled vessel of some kind. Upon excavation of 7219 using the HAP, it was found that there was an additional pit (7224) that had been sealed by the plastering of floor 7219. This was excavated and found to contain a very gritty coarse ash matrix and mud brick slump but little to no cultural material. Another pit that was uncovered northeast of the plastered 7219 pit and actually below this floor cutting into subsurface fill 7222 was left unexcavated this season and will need to be returned to next year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Pits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several pits were excavated throughout the season in F7 with many quite large in size, averaging between 1.5-2 meters is diameter and 0.5-1 meter in depth. In fact, some pit loci (7181, 7193, 7199) were not fully excavated down to the basal levels based on the need to focus excavations in other features of the trench. Despite the presence of cultural debris that resided within the pits as secondary contexts, the pits themselves were lacking in any sort of plaster or stone lining (save for one, see bin 7186) that would aid in interpreting function during their different times of use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first major pit to be excavated was located in the southwest corner of the trench emerging from the south baulk (7146). This pit was a continuation of pit 9045 located along the north baulk of trench F9 that was also excavated this season. Apart from a pot cluster that was recovered from the top elevations of the locus and carbon samples that were taken from the extreme basal levels of the pit, no other defining characteristics were unearthed to suggest any kind of function for this pit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A second major pit that was excavated was located in the northwest corner of the trench cutting directly into the southern edge of wall 7154 and all the associated surfaces (7170, 7182, 7185, 7189, 7194) and fill (7196). This pit was especially deep (reaching just over a meter) with a level bottom elevation apart from a smaller interior pit that was roughly 30-40cm in diameter and 50 cm in depth. Again the exact function of this pit is unavailable, although its stratigraphic relationship to the walls and floors in this area suggest a later date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The third large pit (7181) to be excavated came from the northeast quadrant of the trench and at this time, has been hypothesized as congruent with structure 7178 and burial 7183/7221. This pit was found to be unique in that the edge was lined with a single course of burnt mud bricks that encompassed the entirety of the lip of the locus. Connected to the top of these bricks were multiple superimposed compacted mud or mud plaster surfaces (three total), to top most as light gray in color and the following two with evidence for burning. It is perhaps the case then that when the pit went out of use, it was filled and plastered over and then later, for whatever reason, was burned along with the rim of bricks. Whether or not this burning episode is connected with that from the 7154/7163 structure is unclear, as pit 7181 is not actually visible in the north baulk section to be associated with the long layer of ash (7164/7161) that caps walls 7163 and 7154, nor does the ashy fill of locus 7153 extend east far enough to encompass pit 7181.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another enigmatic feature located in the northeast corner of the trench was an ovoid shallow pit or bin 7186 that was partially lined with compacted mud or mud plaster layer on the northern end. The center was composed of loose soil with ash. Mud bricks abutted the locus on the west, south and lower east ends with burnt mud brick debris also coming from the southern area of the locus. The bin's association with pit 7181 can be inferred based on proximity, however the overall function of the bin itself and how or if it was used congruently with 7181 is unclear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The final large pits to discuss were each cutting into fill loci 7207 and 7211 respectively on either sides of wall 7209 in the center of the trench. Pit 7193 on the eastern side of the wall was "bathtub" shaped and contained no distinguishing characteristics apart from a compacted sherd cluster that emerged from the northern section of the pit. Pit 7199 was located on the western side of wall 7209 and was found to be abutting on its southern end child burial 7200. This pit was circular in shaped and filled with very fine ash and dark brown silt. Both pits 7193 and 7199 were not fully excavated to their bottom levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally a specific kind of pit locus that was excavated this season deserves discussion. This includes loci 7192, 7206, and 7218 whose features included mud plaster lining whereby compacted soil fill was able to be "popped" out/away from the lined bottom which curved in to form a conical shape (7192) and in other cases an internal lining composed of pot sherds of various wares and fabrics that were highly compacted in a sandy pebble matrix (7206, 7218). In all the cases this feature was associated with some kind of structure or wall suggesting that the pits functioned at the time of the building. Their exact function seems unclear though it was suggested by the Director that these could have served as some kind of pot stand for zir/pithoi-type vessels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Small Finds and Other Objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The general character of small finds and other objects that were recovered this season point to an overall "domestic" function for this area of the site. Items such as obsidian and flint blade fragments (which include sickle blade fragments), basalt grinding stone fragments, animal figurines, miniature vessels and cups, a small amount of shell beads, and stone pendants can be considered everyday household items that, put a different way, do not point to any highly organized commercial activities such as metal smelting or large-scale craft production. A few items including andiron fragments and bronze pins do suggest that metallurgy or the trade in metals was present at the site. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An assortment of whole vessels, the most common being footed and pedestalled deep bowls, were also uncovered and excessively important for dating purposes. Based on pottery readings performed in the lab, these vessel types are most probably connected with an early EBA date but could be extended back to encompass a late Late Chalcolithic or even transitional phase date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Baulk Profiles and Drawings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This season entire baulks were not drawn, instead the northwest corner of the trench including the northernmost end of the west baulk and the western half of the north baulk were drawn. This particular area was chosen for section drawings based on the level of clear stratigraphy that was visible and that details of this section will be key in associating features in this northwest corner of the trench. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As already mentioned, these features include walls 7154 and 7163 with associated floors, all of which are clearly sealed by a relatively thick layer of ash and mud brick debris that seem to be related to a destruction episode. It should be noted that when excavating wall 7163 it was evident that this ash sealed the very top of the wall, however in section this sealing is less clear. The drawing reflects the presence of either a white mud brick that is significantly different in color from the lower-most brick in 7163 which directly touches the ash layer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;this white bricky area is not a mud brick at all but simply fill on top of the wall. This latter suggestion is offered based on the fact that at least two medium-sized pot sherds are visible inclusions within this layer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also became visible with the section profiles that the ash layer continues into the west section where it seals a third mud brick wall that was missed in excavation but is clearly abutting if not bonded with at least the topmost floor (7168) from this corner that was also bonded with wall 7163 on its western face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is also visible in the direct northwest corner that was not detected when excavating in this area was a 40cm deep pit that based on both the west and north section, was cut into floors 7168 and 7174. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally in other baulk sections that were not drawn a few mud brick features were noted including a small wall in the center of the western section and either a wall or mud brick slump in the northern section in the northeast corner of the trench. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In general the 2005 season in trench F7 was a successful one in that many solid contexts such as superimposed floors and walls were able to be recovered and recorded. Based on pottery readings, which will need to be coupled with the results from carbon testing, the levels that were excavated this season seem to coincide with the very end of the Late Chalcolithic period and bleed into this transitional phase into the very beginnings of the EBA. Therefore the goals for next season will be continued excavations in this trench to reach the early to mid Chalcolithic levels and examine how these new contexts compare and/or connect with finds from F4 and F9 that were excavated this season. The ultimate goal in this trench will be the recovery of the full Chalcolithic sequence which can be in turn analyzed along with the long sequences of occupation that were discovered in other trenches from area F such as F1 and F4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
