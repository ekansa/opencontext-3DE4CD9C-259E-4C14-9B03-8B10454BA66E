   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Trench Summary, Year 2005 Season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Area G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 26, 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;G9 is a new 5 x 10m trench on the northeastern area of the site just north of the tepe itself. It is located 5 meters to the west of G7 and is oriented North/South on its long axis. The G8 sounding is also to the north of G9. The G9/G7 datum point is located north of the trenches, near the northern baulk of the G8 sounding. It is 579.57m above sea level. The trench was started new this season and reached a depth of 1.23m on the southern half, 2.25m on the northern half, and 3.67m for the sounding between the two. The G9 sounding is located in the northern half of the trench on the western baulk and the height difference between the northern and southern parts of the trench. This trench was placed here in an attempt to investigate the tepe occupation for that area. With various occupation levels found on the tepe itself and then farther down towards the Tigris River, it was our goal to trace occupation between these two areas. During the previous 2004 season G7 had been opened to begin this investigation. Trench G9 was an extension of that goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Description of Excavation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The excavation of G9 was started on May 16, 2005. After removing an initial layer of topsoil (L1), a stone wall stub (L2) was uncovered less than 10cm below the surface. Below this wall stub was fill and then below that was another possible stone associated to that feature (L11) was uncovered. Then below this locus was uncovered locus 13, a very compact surface containing cultural material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A subsoil layer (L3) was then removed uncovering in the southern area of the trench an area of domestic refuse and usage. From this point on, the trench was arbitrarily divided into northern and southern halves. I will discuss the southern half first and then the northern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Southern Section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locus 4 was created to encompass the domestic fill because of the presence of two relatively complete pedestalled vessels found upturned, with other associated pottery fragments and faunal remains (KT G.9.4.1-2). In the same area of the trench, the top of an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tandur (oven) was uncovered (L7). The tandur was excavated like a pit, using a hand trowel and brushes, with an effort made to not disturb the feature itself. Loci 6 and 8 were removed as fill of the tandur. Locus 6 was the top portion of the fill and was divided from L8 by a layer of stones and broken pottery. The fill below this layer became locus 8. Soil and carbon samples were collected from both levels of fill. The tandur was preserved to almost its complete height during use. Once the base of the tandur was reached through L8, the exterior was excavated as subsoil fill locus 10. The tandur was photographed to its preserved height and the area around the exterior was removed as L10. There was no clear demarcation of a surface around the tandur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A subsoil fill layer was removed as L15. A good amount of cultural material was found, but no clear contexts were uncovered until L16. L16 is a possible pebble feature/dump that was partially picked through along the southwestern baulk. This locus was originally selected for Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP) sample collection. A ½ m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; area was laid out and removed to the base of what we thought was the surface at that point. The rest of the locus was removed, screened, and the volume was estimated at 612 liters when we stopped screening it. The locus was sampled based on this protocol, but was not collected to 100% completion. This is due partially to the original missing of the locus and picking through its northern boundary, but then also during the course of the excavation we began to question it actually being a surface rather than a pebble dump. Through excavation no breaks were found indicating multiple levels of surfaces, but it continued down in some places to a depth of approximately 40cm. After removal of the pebble matrix from L16, a compact bricky locus remained (L18) that appears to have built up at the same time as the pebble fill. It had a step-like appearance with the pebbles mounded up on top of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last active locus for the southern half of the trench was subsoil fill removal for L15. Within this locus along the southeastern baulk was found two upturned cooking vessels (KT.G.9.15.32-33). At this point the excavation in the southern half of the trench was stopped and the focus turned to the northern section and the sounding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Northern section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsoil locus 9 was removed in order to investigate the presence of good contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At approximately the same depth as the domestic refuse from locus 4, were located two human burials along the eastern baulk of the trench. The first burial (L5) was removed completely, while the second (L17) was partially preserved in the baulk and remains there. For a detailed discussion of the L5 burial, see journal entries for the day of May 23 as well as the second week of excavation for G9. The fill below the burial (L12) contained a great deal of charcoal flecks and some other cultural material. Directly to the south of the burial was found what is possibly a complete, but shattered, coarse ware cooking vessel. No other grave goods were found. The locus 17 burial was much less better preserved and both removal and examination were difficult. For brief notes on the burial from locus 17 see the daily journal for May 29, 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point locus 14 was removed as subsoil fill. Below this locus, in the northeast corner of the trench, a small ceramic vessel was uncovered containing approximately 100 beads of shell, rock crystal, and stone as well as one metal coil. Based on its corrosive properties, the coil was probably made from either silver or lead. For a detailed description of this cache, see daily journal notes from June 1, 2005 and the small finds report for KT G.9.19.1-.62. This locus (L19) was discovered during the big pick removal of the L14 subsoil fill and was damaged during discover. The surrounding matrix was very hard and compact, making trowel excavation slow and difficult. An arbitrary 1m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; locus (L19) was created around the vessel to determine if there was any thing else associated with this cache of beads. This locus was excavated mainly by trowel but also by careful use of small pick when necessary due to the difficult nature of the surrounding soil. Nothing else was discovered related to the vessel, so L20 subsoil fill locus was created to continue excavation in that area. Within L20 a pit was uncovered (L21) and removed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to the lack of cultural remains found in this portion of the trench at this depth, a sounding was placed in G9 to investigate the extent of occupation/use of this area. The sounding was placed at the juncture between the western baulk and the north/south break between the two halves of the trench. The first sounding locus removed was L22, but there was nothing of cultural importance found. Within the second sounding locus (L23) an interesting level containing a great deal of ash and burned material was uncovered. A partially broken vessel containing ash was removed from this locus (KT.G.9.23.4). The remaining sounding loci (L24, L25, L26, and L27) were comprised of a dense pebbly matrix with very little cultural remains. At this point both the sounding and the trench were stopped. We currently believe that this sort of pebble matrix is actually the equivalent to virgin soil found in other areas of the excavation. Due to geological processes that we do not completely understand at this point, we believe that this buildup of pebbly material was a natural occurrence and that there was no occupation or use of this area that can be investigated archaeologically at this time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;No baulks were drawn from trench G9 during the 2005 season. This trench was closed on June 7, 2005. The excavation of this trench allowed us to investigate the occupation of this particular area of Kenan Tepe and helped us to answer research goals related to the overall excavation of the site. But in and of itself, there was not a great amount of good contexts that were uncovered. Therefore our energies and attentions were focused elsewhere on the site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The interpretive portion of this trench summary will begin at the earliest indication of occupation/use of this trench and move forwards in time to the most recent. The earliest evidence of use of this area by a human population comes from L23 the sounding locus with a thick layer of ash and the partially preserved ceramic vessel. This could have been a part of a cooking installation or some other domestic activity area. No other evidence of occupation/use was found here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then more recently was the bead cache (L19) found in the northeast corner of the trench. There was no visible pit or other cut into which this vessel was sunk, nor was there any evidence of a house or other feature associated with the vessel. Due to the vessel’s placement close to the corner of the trench, it is possible that other associated archaeological remains are just outside the limits of the G9 trench, but there is no way of determining that at this point. We currently believe that the beads were stored for future retrieval, but for what ever reason were not returned for. This cache could have represented significant personal importance and/or monetary worth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The third level of occupation/use for the G9 trench comes in the southern portion of the trench with the associated loci, 15 and 16. There was a good amount of domestic refuse here including the upturned cooking vessels which might represent cultural fill or trash dump. This could coincide with the curious pebble deposition of L16. The buildup over time of the pebbles and the associated bricky surface (L18) could represent a similar trash dumping area that was used over time creating this buildup of material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally we come to the most recent level of occupation/use of this area, the tandur and associated fills (L6, 7, 8, and 10). This portion of the trench was used for food preparation activities, as represented by the clay oven (tandur) and other cultural remains found here. The other loci associated with this depth of occupation are the two burials (L5 and 17). These two burials may be associated with this same level of occupation/use or may be incursions cut into this level from a later time period. There was no definable pit for either burial. But the presence of the coarse ware vessel with the L5 burial suggests that this might have also been associated with the time period that the tandur was in use. Further investigation of the ceramics from both areas of use and of the carbon samples taken from both areas would be necessary before further hypotheses can be put forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, this area of the tepe does not seem to have been extensively used in the past. Some cooking installations at different time periods were present as were the two burials and the bead cache, but no other domestic structures or features were uncovered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Loose Ends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In future excavation activities related to G9, it might be helpful to draw the northern and perhaps eastern baulks of the trench. Especially in the northern portion of the trench there was a great deal of very hard and compact fill that was taken out primarily with big picks and shovels. At one point in the northern baulk it became clear that a possible floor or hard plaster surface was cut through, but there had not been any cultural remains associated with that feature so it was not discovered until seen in profile. None of the interesting features found in trench G7 were repeated in G9, such as the pithos burials or the short stone wall demarking a road. It is possible that these features continue in the 5m baulk between these two trenches, but this will not be known without further excavation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
