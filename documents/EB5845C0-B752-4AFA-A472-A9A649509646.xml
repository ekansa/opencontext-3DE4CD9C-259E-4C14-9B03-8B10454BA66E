      <arch:string>At the end of each week, trench supervisors were expected to write a concise summary of the previous week’s activities.  The purpose of this weekly summary was to review the week’s notes, check for completeness, identify any mistakes or missing information, and to begin building interpretations.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Trench Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;August 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;vertical-align:super" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt; 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excavations in trench A8 encountered patterns, which on some levels are particular to the excavation of step trenches generally, but also ones particular to this trench. Specifically this relates to the increasingly clean contexts encountered in loci closer to the center of the mound, and relatively mixed contexts in loci further down slope, or in the case of A8 to the north. This tendency was exacerbated because of the deep sequence of walls, which were reached immediately below sub-topsoil up against the southern baulk. The position of the trench, which lies entirely north in relation to the walls, meant that loci to the north of the wall sequence were always mixed and fill-like, whilst cleaner contexts were left unexcavated in the baulk of A2 to the south. The terracing of the mound in ancient times further emphasized the lack of clean contexts, since spill lines, predominantly consisting of wall collapse from the wall sequences, continued for several meters down slope. The latter are visible clearly in the east and west sections of the trench. In summary, greatest attention was directed towards the southern extreme of the trench, where the wall sequences were encountered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The excavation of the wall loci – principally defined by loci 5, 15, 18 and 33 - in the southern extreme of the trench was subject to a number of problems stemming for incorrect interpretations. The orientation of the first wall sequence, locus 5 was not clear, but it seemed to run from south to north on the western side of the trench. A gray fill to the east briefly interrupted a generally brick-like area, which continued to the east as loci 3 and 11. The gray area was subsequently recognized as pitting activity, cutting the wall, which extends into the eastern baulk, hence running more from east to west. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next sequence of mud brick architecture was encountered almost 1 meter down, and was excavated as locus 15. However, the feeling that the end of wall 5 was indeed reached, and that wall 15 represented a distinct sequence was again based on erroneously interpreted information. Loci 12 and 14 lie between walls 5 and 15, and are characterized by the impressions left from decomposing organic material, principally in the form of river reeds. These white surface-like deposits were initially interpreted as living surfaces, even though suspicion over the paucity of artifacts within their matrix was raised early. Further such surfaces were encountered beneath wall 15 as loci 21 and 30, the latter resting over the third and final wall sequence: stonewall 33. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both walls 5 and 15 consist of mud brick, which alternates between green, brown, red, yellow and gray in color. However their orientation is still questionable since mud brick is clearly seen in the southern section for wall 5, whilst wall 15 largely disappears in the southern section, compared to the greater number of courses encountered further to the north and in the west section. This fact raises the possibility that wall 15 ran slightly diagonal to the trench, and is hence distinct from wall 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The white organic deposits were subsequently reinterpreted as wet courses in the wall construction. However their relationship to the wall sequences is unclear. It is clear for instance that the white deposits do not align with the walls entirely, nor do they cover any of the wall sequences entirely either. Locus 12 lies below wall 5 but does not extend as far as the wall. Locus 14 likewise does not align directly below wall 15. The same is true of loci 21 and 30 in relation to wall 33. Furthermore these organic deposits do not overlie one another but are positioned in a staggered fashion so that one occurs higher and to the side of a subsequent lower deposit. The existence of these deposits as wet courses in the construction may explain the hiatus of mud brick between walls 5 and 15, and may reinforce the notion that these two sequences of mud brick indeed belong to the same wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The hypothesis of one continuous wall was extended to include the final wall sequence, locus 33. However a number of problems rest in this interpretation, which includes wall 33 as the stone foundations of the mud brick superstructure represented by walls 5 and 15. Objections to the hypothesis of one wall come in the form of three strains of evidence:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;The position of the organic deposits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;The fill above, to the north, and below the stone courses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li dir="ltr" style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;span&gt;The nature and content of the brick collapse, and spill lines to the north&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking the first argument, we notice that the white organic loci 30, 21 and 14 all extend well beyond the northern limit of the stone rows of wall 33. In addition, the obvious collapse of wall 33, easily visible in the eastern section, lies beneath loci 21 and 14. This scenario indicates that either these deposits were laid after the collapse of wall 33, or that they have moved with the collapsing structure. The latter seems very unlikely given the almost perfectly horizontal position of the organic layers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second argument raises the problem that the fill below, to the north, and above wall 33 is the same. This fill is composed of a dense, extremely hard-packed, clay-like deposit rich in bones. The fill was excavated as locus 29 above the stonewall, locus 40 at the level of the stonewall, and locus 45 below the stonewall. The only reasonable explanation for this is that natural fills were deposited over time against the standing wall 33. After the collapse of the wall, these fills continued to gather, depositing against and above the collapse; indeed the line of these deposits follows the slope line. Finally, in a rebuilding of the wall, reed surfaces were used to lay down foundational wet courses. This idea is strengthened by the discovery of mud bricks in the southern section at the level of wall 33 but not above it (see below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The third argument concerns the evidence in the eastern and western sections. The western section in particular shows three clear spill lines. The upper line comprises the topsoil and sub-topsoil of later mixed fills excavated as locus 2. The second line comprises mud brick debris relating to the first wall sequence excavated as loci 17, 23, 27, 28, 29, 38 and 39. The third clear line showing a pebble spill surface on a slope with deteriorated mud bricks above it, relate possibly to the earliest wall with stone foundations, which was excavated as loci 38, 39, 40 and 41. The lower, hard-packed surface represents the loci described above excavated as 42 and 45. These spill lines link up well with individual sequences in the walls with their own separate episodes of collapse. At this stage all these wall sequences seem to date to the third millennium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stonewall 33 merits further description. Stonewall 33 itself follows a northwest to southeast orientation. The one-meter wall foundations, which rise, at least 7 courses in places, do not contain an associated foundation trench, and extend only 1 meter in width. This wall seems to be broadened by mud bricks, which extend into the southern baulk. It is therefore impossible to estimate the width of the wall other than to say that it is broader than 1.5 meters. In addition, no clear living surfaces can be associated with this wall. It is reasonable to speculate that associated surfaces are to be found to the south, in the baulk of A2. The stonewall was built on a north-south slope, but its construction suggests that a further east-west slope existed in ancient times. A course of stone and a mud brick foundation underlies the wall only in the west part of the wall, which raises questions over the orientation of the slope. The absence of stones in the spill line associated with the collapse suggests that the superstructure of this wall was composed of mud brick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beneath the mud brick foundation placed only on the western half of the trench, a uniform hard-packed brown earth was encountered, which seemed identical to the fill beside the wall to the north, and immediately below the wall to the east. The fill to the north quickly yielded debris with mud brick slump and pebbles, marked as loci 46 and 47. Locus 46 in particular was defined by a series of ash lenses containing substantial pottery. The excavation of the mud brick foundation below wall 33 found the same ash deposits as locus 46, but the former were much more abundant and clearly striated, interspersed with a series of brown fill layers. These sequences contained good carbon samples, as well as bone, lithics and pottery. The ash under the wall excavated as locus 49 and produced a rare stone seal on the last day of excavations. These deposits predate the foundation of wall 33 and represent potentially the first clear surface deposits in the trench. The remaining loci to the north represent topsoils, sub-topsoils, and wall debris. A broken, cobblestone surface – locus 44 - was discovered in the far north of the trench, but this was ephemeral, and lacking in good diagnostic artifacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench A8 therefore represents the remains of a long sequence of wall construction and rebuilding episodes, largely dated to the third millennium, but which lacks associated surfaces. The final days of the excavation reached the end of the wall sequence and found surfaces not associated with any architecture.	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
