   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AREA: F TRENCH: 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;FINAL SUMMARY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        F14 was opened on Jul 8, 2002 on the west of F7 (10 by 10 trench) as 5 by 10 trench. Firstly, its east part (1 by 9) was dug as L1 (topsoil). We choose this area to dig because we wanted to see any relationships between F14 and F7. After digging this area 30cm, we found a cobblestones area on the middle of it (4.85m from the north baulk and 3.20m from the south baulk). L3 was given to this area; L2 was given to the south of it and L4 was given to the north of it. To find the other part of L3, we dug the west of it (2x3m; between 4m from north baulk and 2m from south baulk) and we realized it was continuing through 1.75m through the west. L5 was given to the south of it (1x2m). We supposed about this cobble stones area was a burial but after taking rocks up we could not find anything about this. However, L3 was rich about pottery and bones. After taking rocks off, its north (the middle part of L1; 1x2m), its south (L5; 1x2m) and L3 were taken new locus number, L6, because there was no different structure between them.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        When we dug l4 (the northeast part of the trench; 1x4m) 20cm we found a skeleton on the north part of L4 and to see it clearly, this area was widened 0.5m from the north baulk through the north and 1m from east baulk through the west. It was dug 60-70cm down within 5cm of level of burial. This area was taken L7. The skeleton appeared to be lying in a flexed position on its right side, with the head facing east because cranium appeared in very north end of this 1m wide trench. The inventory for the burial was that: 3 thoracic vertebras; multiple rib fragments; humerus; radius; ulna; clavicle; scapula; single hand phalanx and skull. Burial was definitely detached at waist. On Jul 30, 2002; the skeleton pieces were taken off and this area waited to the last day of the excavation with same level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        L4 (the northeast part of the trench; between 5m from the south baulk and 7.65m from south baulk), L2 (the southeast part of the trench) and the east part of L6 (1x1m; the middle east part of the trench) took a new locus number, L8 (1x7.5m) because they had same structure and we wanted to dig this area to see on east baulk any relationship with F7 (the east of F14). L8 was dug 60-70cm and we saw that on the south part of east baulk there were 3 brick sections and plaster lines. The top plaster line looked like falling through the south. And also we saw this structure on the south of L6 and to see it clearly the south of L6 was dug 80cm to take same level with L6. The first 20cm of soil (topsoil) was L1; the second 30cm of soil was L9 (silt loam); the third 30cm of soil was L10 (compacted loam). After having same level between L6 and L10 we found 4 huge rocks (which were close with each other) between L6 and L10. And also on L10 there were lots of disorganized plasters. We thought that we could find a wall on this area but we could not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        Because of the brick sections and plaster lines on the south part of the south baulk we decided to widen the trench 2m through the east to see is there any wall or not. Its south border began 1m from south baulk through the north and it covered 2m areas through the north and 2m areas through the east. This area was dug 50cm. First 10cm was L11 (topsoil); second 20cm was L12 (silt loam); third 10cm was L13 (compact loam) and final 10cm was L14 (compacted silt loam). As a result, we could not find anything about a wall but on L14 there were some huge rocks so we wanted to widen the trench through the north. And finally, the trench was widened 2m through the east from the east baulk and 6m through the north from L14’s border. This area was dug 60cm. First 10cm was L15 (topsoil); second 40cm was L16. On the middle of L16, we found a foundation wall (3.25x1.70m), L19, and also L16 was really rich about pottery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        We wondered about is this wall continuing through the east or not; so we decided to widen the trench through the east 2m and 6m on the north-south direction. This area was dug 50cm. First 20cm was L17 (topsoil); second 20cm was L18 (silt loam). L18 was really rich about pottery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        On the last day of the excavation, L16 was changed as L21 and L18 was changed as L20 because L19, the wall, was between them and one of them should be inside or outside; so they had different structure from each other. And L20 and L21 were dug 10cm. L20 was rich about pottery. Especially, we found many pieces of jars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        After having the same level between L20, 21, 22 and 14; L7 (the middle-north of the trench) was dug 10-20cm to take same level with the others (L20, 21, 22, 14). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;        F14 was rich about pottery. The period of F14 was Early Bronze Age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;                                                      THE END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
