   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;C2 TRENCH SUMMARY 2001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	C2 lies on the western slope of the tepe. The trench shares a baulk with C3- the southwest corner of C2 is the northwest corner of C3. C1 and C4 are nearby to the north. This year we are continuing the excavation of this trench which was opened last year. C2 is a 5x5, though the baulks seem to be creeping outward. The starting elevations for this year generally lay between 93.5 and 92.5m. At the end of the season the northwest corner on top of the wall was at 92.99m, the surfaces and pits in the south were in the range of the 92.40s m, and the rest of the trench was generally in the range of the 92.60s m. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The goals for this year were to get through all the offseason wash and erosion and to begin to understand the relationships between the walls found last year and any associated surfaces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	This year was not a large dirt moving operation as shown by the beginning and ending elevations for the season. C2 was excavated primarily with small picks and trowels. We dug this way because most of our effort was focused on determining the stratigraphic relationships between the various walls, surfaces, and pits. Soil was not screened because of time constraints. Altogether the excavation proceeded slowly with the painstaking removal of thin layers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Excavation Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Excavation began with the cleaning of wash and erosion from the off season. Cleaning loci include 2050-2054. The southwest part of the trench was covered by a jumble of stones and the northeast was mudbricky and riddled with rodent burrows. As cleaning continued an extensive ashy area appeared in the northeast. It seems that rodent burrows are responsible for its extent. The soft soil would have been conducive to rodent activity and could have spread the ash beyond the original border of the ash pit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	As walls 2048 and 2046 were cleaned off the boundaries became more clear. The picture also started to clear up in the southwest where a semicircular arrangement of stones began to demarcate a pit, 2057. A gray ashy pit was also becoming visible in the southeast, 2061. Meanwhile a mudbrick wall, 2067, was becoming apparent starting in the north center of the trench and running to the southwest. This wall was cleaned and defined. It consisted of 2 courses. The courses were taken off one at a time and it was found that the wall was underlaid by an ashy surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Once everything had been cleaned up, more or less, we could begin to understand the stratigraphy of the trench. We started by taking down the lower wall, 2046. While taking down the western part of the wall we uncovered another wall, later named 2088. The new wall was oriented more to the northwest than the overlying wall. We also began to examine the pits that were appearing in the southwest quadrant of the trench. We started with 2082, a sealed pt beginning about a meter north of the south baulk along the west baulk. A couple of grinding stones were found. At the bottom of 2083, a pit in the southwest corner, a surface began to appear. We moved on to a large pit in the south central part of the trench (originally 2076, but excavated as 2084), originally thought to be a metal working pit based on the finding of slag in context. This pit was excavated very slowly, peeling away at it layer by layer and taking photos after each. 2084 was surrounded by a pile of stones which was taken off as a separate locus 2087. The area surrounding 2087 and 2084 was dug as 2075. Here we were looking for the relationships between walls, 2048 and 2088, and pit 2084. This uncovered another course of stones belonging to 2088.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	In the northwest we found two pits enclosed within an area of fill by 2048 and a mudbrick wall, 2080. In the southeast we took down the remainder of 2046 as 2094. Below this lay more of the gray ashy area, 2090. We also found another ash pit, 2101, just to the north of 2088 which was rich in carbon samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The most interesting area of the trench was the south central part. Below 2075 we uncovered a surface which seemed to extend to the southwest corner. At about the same time we reached another surface at the bottom of 2084. It was at this point that we realized that we had a room with two levels of occupation. We peeled back to find the extension of the upper surface, 2095 and found that it did indeed extend to the southwest corner. Interestingly, this surface overlaid the southern part of 2048. The surface was bounded on the east by 2088. This extensive and deep surface yielded a great amount of pottery. 2095 could be related to surface 2089 in the northeast which is at a similar level, but that relationship is not totally clear. The lower surface was excavated as 2099. As we worked westward we found that the surface stopped at the old boundary of 2083. Here instead we found a broken line of white plaster and mud feature, renamed 2098. Immediately north of 2098 is an area of fill which may overlay part of 2099.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	After digging had ceased for the season and we were taking photos we noticed that mudbrick wall 2080 could extend under 2048 over to 2101. It could also extend to the southeast corner as the soil there is very hard. No clear lines were defined, though. It also looks as if we have a mudbrick wall on the eastern edge of 2091 abutting 2048.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Finds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Nothing truly spectacular was found in C2 this year. The finds were mostly domestic in nature with grindstones (10 total) being the most abundant, but 2 pestles, 3 oven bases, a couple of obsidian blade pieces and a stone bowl fragment were also found. In addition we recovered a netweight, a piece of bronze, and a worked stone disc. Most of the items were found in pits or surfaces on the south and west sides of the trench, though the stone disc and one grindstone were found in the northeast part of the trench in the fill above and below surface 2089.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;Interpretations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The stratigraphy of C2 was fairly complex. Just as things looked like they were making sense, new surfaces or other complications emerged. By the end of the season, though, the picture became clearer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	The most complicated and interesting part of the trench was the south central region bounded by walls 2048 and 2088, and including pit 2084. Within this region are two surfaces: 2095 the upper surface and 2099 the lower surface. The lower surface is bounded on the east by wall 2088 and ends abruptly in the west at the old boundary of pit 2083. Upon this surface was founded both walls 2048 and 2088. It also serves as the lower boundary of pit 2084. The relationship between this surface and the one it abuts in the west (2098 a mud and plaster feature) remains unclear. Over time refuse built up on 2099 and began to spill over onto 2048. This indicates that 2048 was out of use by this time. Here it became the upper surface which extended from the west baulk to 2088. It was into this surface that 2084 was cut. A circle of stones (2087) was then piled around the pit. Within pit 2086 we started to see the beginning of a surface which could be related to either the upper or the lower surfaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	In the southeast part of the trench lies a grey ashy pit area, 2090, the extent of which was not dug. It is probably related to the lower surface as the ash continues under 2088. To the north of 2088 lies another ash pit, 2101. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	In the northeast lay a chunky surface, 2089. This is at about the same level as 2095 so the two may be related. The picture remains unclear for now. Just to the south of 2089 is an area of fill with patches that could represent mudbricks, but we were unable to define any clear lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	In the northwest we found two pits inside a fill locus which was bounded by 2048 on the north and east and by a mudbrick wall 2080 on the south. It is possible that these were fire pits enclosed within a fire shield. After digging had stopped and photos were being taken it was observed that 2080 could actually extend below wall 2048 to the carbon rich ash pit 2101. This would place the mudbrick wall under stone wall 2046 as well. 2080 could reach as far as the southeast corner as this area is hard and mudbricky. If this is the case then 2101 must cut 2080. How this mudbrick wall relates to the surfaces in the south and northeast reaches of the trench remains to be seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"&gt;State of the Trench&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	All in all we ceased excavation this year at a good point. We were able to piece together some of the stratigraphic relationships within the trench and by leaving the walls in place we allow for future investigation into any remaining questions. Several issues have been raised. The first concerns 2080, its extent and relation to the above described surfaces and pits. Does it actually continue to the southeast corner? Does it relate in any way to the hard patches in the eastern part of the trench? Another mudbrick wall also seems to be appearing in the eastern part of 2091, abutting 2048. Did 2048 cut into this? The ashy southeast also remains unclear. Further excavation is especially needed in the southwest corner to determine what is going on with the mud and plaster feature and any appearing surfaces. The features of the south central region of the trench may also extend into trench C3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
