      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weekly journal 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;B4 is a 10x10 meter trench south of Area A and just east of Area C. B1 is the SW corner that’s been excavated in a previous season. During its excavation an Iron Age surface was discovered that appeared to continue into the NW ¼ of the trench, and possibly the SE ¼ of this trench. Hence, the goal of the 2002 season was to reach this Iron Age context. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started the excavation on the 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of August, fairly late in the season. In order to trace the whereabouts of the surface we cut all the baulks back and checked the profiles of the Northern and Eastern sidewalls. Although the surface was clearly present in the Northern Baulk, we opted to dig the SE quarter of B4 where we could only slightly see the possibility of a surface. We did this mainly because there was a lot of fill above where the surface might be, thus the possibility for contamination was a lot lower than that of the NW quarter (where there was less fill above the surface). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We opened the SE quadrant by defining five separate cleaning loci. L4028, 4029, 4030, 4031, 4032 were all separate plateaus at differing elevations, left over from last season’s excavations. We dug about 10cm off each of them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we were cleaning the trench we exposed 3 separate rock features. L4037 and L4038 may be related. They look like they could be part of a larger rock wall. There is a gap that runs between them, but they appear to be directly in line with each other along the Southern baulk. L4039 is a rock pile in the center of the trench that doesn’t seem to be associated with anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also uncovered the pit L4034. The pit contained a very fine, silty soil with a bit of ash mixed in. When we were scraping it out we found a burial. We decided to cover it up and leave it for next year, as we don’t have very much time left this season. Thus, at the time of writing there remains a squared-off section in the Eastern baulk that will not be excavated this season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We scraped out L4036, a pit that was leftover from last season that is just next to the baulk on the western side of the trench. It contained two large rocks at the bottom, but the rest of it was excavated previously and, therefore, nothing noteworthy remaining inside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I started digging L4033, which comprised the eastern side of the trench. In the Northern half of the trench, it was bordered by a compact, mudbricky fill (L4035). In the southern half it was bordered more arbitrarily by an elevation difference that has been leftover from last season. Hence, part of the goal with this locus was to make the bottom of the trench more level so that we could define loci better.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After L4033 was finished, it appeared as if the soil was fairly homogenous throughout the trench, except for L4035 (the mudbricky fill). We wanted to expose more of L4035 to see if we could find a wall, or some definitive association with the large amounts of mud brick we were finding. Hence, I started digging L4041, which encompasses the southern half of the trench. We were trying to move fairly quickly, thus we decided to excavate this locus in 10-15 centimeter arbitrary levels in order to keep working towards the Iron Age surface. After we attained a profile of L4035, we realized that it was composed of nothing but mudbricky fill. Because of the elevation differences leftover from last season, it worked out that, after excavating it, it ended up being level with the bottom of L4033 and the bottom of L4032.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once L4035 was excavated, the soil throughout the trench appeared to be homogenous. Thus, I made the soil for the whole trench L4042. I excavated down about 30 centimeters at which point the rock features (L4037, 4038, 4039, 4040) were pedestaled above L4042. I should have removed these features before excavating L4042, but I was waiting for Drew to come up and take a spider shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the spider shot, I excavated all of the rock features including L4046 and L4044. I wasn’t going to give these two rock features numbers because they both only consist of 4 rocks each. But, for the posterity of the spider shot I wanted to save them and since I excavated them after the larger soil locus (4042) that they were a part of, I had to give them new locus numbers. This was also true of all the soil that each of the features was pedestaled upon (L4045, 4049, 4050, 4048, 4053). All of these loci are, in fact, the same type of soil as L4042. The only reason for the new locus numbers is because they were all excavated after L4042.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the rocks were excavated, we decided to flatten the bottom of the trench so that we could define loci. L4051 covers the same space as L4042, and includes anywhere from 1-5cm of excavated soil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It appears as if we’ve gone far enough to reach the Iron Age surface. However, we cannot see it in any of the baulks. Hence, Andy is planning on moving over to the NW quadrant tomorrow!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
