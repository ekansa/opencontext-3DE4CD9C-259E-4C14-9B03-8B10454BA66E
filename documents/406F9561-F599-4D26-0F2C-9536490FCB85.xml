      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench E2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weekly Summary 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;06/09/07 – 06/14/07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. Clark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we began excavation this season, we continued in all of the main areas excavated last week. No locus has changed shape dramatically, and thus many are indeed still open. The large area north of wall L157 had the most interesting occurrences. Last season it was concluded that this area was an outdoor work surface whose purpose continued for many years since its only change was a series of surfaces discovered as excavation moved lower. More surfaces were discovered this week. The surface L164, discovered last week, was removed, uncovering material rich in bone, lithic, and many Ubaid potsherds. Its end revealed a layer of fill, L166, identified as such by an absence of flat laying sherds and pebbles as well as a sharp decline in artifact recovery from the surface above it. We removed 5cm of this fill and quickly realized that we had discovered a new surface, L168. Additionally, during the removal of L166 we found that the southeast corner of the locus directly abutting the eastern baulk and the north side of wall L157 had become extremely ashy and produced many burned artifacts, particularly bone and lithic. This area was extremely different from the surface L168 that it abutted once we completed L166 – the pebbles and flat sherds from L168 did not continue here. Thus this area became L167. The surface also clearly did not extend into L159, the locus in the northeast corner of the trench, and so we continued to excavate this locus separately. We took a HAP sample from L168 after articulating the surface, and then removed the locus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Immediately after the removal of L168 we found a new surface, L169. Our excavation of L168 had only included about 5cm and we stopped when we had taken out all of what we thought were the concentration of artifacts within the surface, but the next day a new surface was clear. The fill between the two surfaces, then, must have been extremely thin and we removed it with L168 because it blended in so smoothly with the large abundance of material and surface.  Again, this new surface did not extend to L159 and L167, and so these continued with separate excavation. We took a HAP sample from L169 and then removed the locus. At the bottom of the surface, all pebbles, flat sherds, and artifacts of L169 had disappeared and this time we had clearly reached a fill locus, which we designated L170. In both surfaces L168 and L169 we encountered multiple pieces of charcoal, which we took as carbon samples for radiocarbon dating. They will hopefully establish a good timeline for these surfaces and the trench as a whole. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week we also made new discoveries about wall L157. In L158, the locus in the southwest corner of the trench bordered by the southern and western baulk and the south side of the cell formed by L157, we removed the dirt that was still attached to the wall. We wanted to see if we were indeed under the wall as we expected. We removed the dirt until we found the bricks of the wall, and discovered that the bottom of the wall is nowhere in sight. We could see 6 courses of bricks, and a scrape at the bottom promised that there would be more. We assumed that this was the case for the entire wall, and to keep the bricks elsewhere preserved we did not reveal the rest of the wall. On the north side of the wall we removed some of the dirt at the beginning of the week, L165. This locus was equal to any locus that had abutted the wall and wasn’t removed completely, and because it was removed before the excavation of L164 it equaled L156 and L163. We did not reveal the wall until the end of the week, however, with L171, which included dirt from L156, L163, L164, L166, L167, L168, and L169. L171 revealed that the wall did not continue in the same manner as it did in the southwestern corner of the trench. We had not yet reached the bottom of the north wall of the cell, but the main extent of wall from the cell only had once shallow course. This course was laid on top of the same ashy soil as L167, which had reached as far as the cell by the time we completed L169. On the southern side of this same area of the wall, which we exposed during excavation of L160, the wall had at least three courses of brick. Possibly the earth had been extremely uneven when the wall was built, or another possibility is that the wall was expanded at a later date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excavation continued this week in three main loci, L158, L160, and L162; we continued to excavated them simultaneously with the main surfaces L168 and L169 in order to keep things level. L158 produced nothing more significant than an increase in artifacts and a few bricks close to the southern baulk. In L160, bricks were found that extended south from wall L157, but not farther than one brick. Possibly this was apart of a cell wall that was not preserved more than this. In L162 of the northwest corner of the trench we discovered new architecture: a row of bricks in the southern area of the locus right between the western baulk and wall L157 that either goes under wall L157 or is attached to it in some fashion, and a row of stones just north of and parallel to the bricks that go right up against the wall and possibly continue under it. The bricks are not yet floating. We will have to remove the wall in order to learn more about this architecture, and whether it goes with the wall or is earlier. The bricks became L175 and the remainder of L162 became L173. Additionally, we continued excavating L59, which never became surfacey and continued with the same, and L167. L167 produced many burned finds, and its borders were constantly changing, expanding, and leaking into the areas around it, meaning that at any one point we could have designated dirt incorrectly and thus some artifacts from the surfaces could belong to this locus or vice versa. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, we began excavation within the cell formed by wall L157 this week. We particularly wanted to reach the bottom of the walls here so we could prepare to remove it next week as well as see if the architecture of L173 and L175 continues under the wall. We intended to bring everything down to the level of the pit where an adult woman skeleton was found last season. In the northwest side of the cell, however, we found another human skeleton. This most likely belonged to a child since the bones were small, and was possibly associated with the woman found in the cell last season. It was not contained in anything, and was so badly preserved that many of its bones were apart of the dirt. It was laid on its side on top of a brick layer, and bricks were laid on top of him. Both brick layers followed the course of the cell wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
