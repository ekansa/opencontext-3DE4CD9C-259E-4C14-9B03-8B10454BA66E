      <arch:string>The purpose of the daily journal was to record the activities taking place in a trench each day. This included which loci were excavated, how and why loci were excavated and the ongoing impressions of the relationships among loci. It should be noted that journals record the actions, impressions and ideas of trench supervisors during the excavations. They are not, therefore, the final interpretations or syntheses of the emerging data.</arch:string>

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Week 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trench 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week was the week that we began truly excavating what turned out to be an ubaid house. We had not started before because Bradley had been away at a conference and Bekir and I were reluctant to start anything without him seeing it first. It was decided that the first order of business would be to bring down the areas that we were uncertain of. To do this I opened locus 78 which is a T shaped locus which encompasses some area against the eastern baulk and a section of the middle of the trench up to the brick feature L74. We brought this area down 5cm and though we didn’t see any other walls we started to see several other things including a small area of rocks. I decided that the next best course of action was to bring down the area inside walls L75, 76, and 77. This inside surface abuts the southern baulk and is locus 79. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 5 it was too rainy and wet to come out in the morning to excavate however I was able to come out that evening. The circumstances, a slightly wet trench along with good late afternoon light, allowed us to see several walls that we had not previously seen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	One of the main things that we did this week was to remove half of the eastern baulk expanding the northern section of the trench 1.3 meters in an area 6.2 meters long. This means that when you are looking at the trench while standing on the southern baulk there is a shallow protrusion on the right side on most of the northern side of the trench. This expansion could not have been extended to the whole trench because of the slope of the Tepe. Once this area was done and cleaned we were able to follow walls L70 and L71 eastward until they connected with a north-south wall creating a small (1.4m x 1.02m) interior space. I kept this section of the wall as an extension of L71 because the corner where the new wall met with L71 was the most clear. This means that L71 is not an ‘L’ shaped locus which runs east-west beginning near the west baulk touching L73, continues west for approx 2.5 meters and then turns north before meeting with L70. The enclosed space made by these three walls plus L72 is L83. The walls were two sections of wall that extended into the new eastern baulk. I made the paralleling pieces of wall extensions of the pre-existing walls L70 and L71. L70 is the northern most wall while L71 is below it to the south. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	 For the new section of L71 we only found one row of brick though in other area of wall L71 there are two and three rows. Once these walls were completely articulated I assigned three new loci to the new areas created by the walls in the northeast corner. The area enclosed by wall L70 and the baulks became L88. South of that was another small enclosed ‘room’ which appears to line up with the other two small rooms. This area became L87. To the south of that we have L89, which does not have borders of walls but instead is partially bordered in the west by the circle of rocks L81.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;	We hit a skull next to wall L70 near the eastern baulk. We at first thought that the skull, which was the highest point of the burial and the first bones that we found, was positioned with the face down. The uppermost bones were very broken and so to articulate the skull we first went down inside and then around the outside of the skull. When we went down inside we found ridges inside the skull which indicated that it was the back of the head. This meant that the face had been up but was so broken that we were unable to identify it. The skull was found only 15 cm below topsoil which might explain why it is in such bad condition. We did find a portion of the jaw with teeth intact. It had full adult molars but the skull size was relatively small, certainly not the size of that of an adult human so I believe that the individual was approx 12 when they died We did not find a full skeleton, instead the only other bones we found were some long bones approx 10cm to the east of the skull. These bones extended into the brick of wall L70. We decided to carve out part of the brick they were stuck into to extract them. The bones extended several centimeters into the brick. The skull and a few long bones were all that we found. This week we also found our fist inside surface, L85 inside walls L75, 76, and 77. It was a packed layer floor with at least one layer of ash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
