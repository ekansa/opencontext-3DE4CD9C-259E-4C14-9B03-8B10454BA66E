   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Trench Summary 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Area F, Trench 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 21, 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I- Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;F1 is a trench located in Area F of the Upper Tigris Archaeological Research Project being conducted at Kenan Tepe. Area F is located on the lower mound of the research project. Trench 1 is located on the south side of the lower mound, near the drop off towards the river. Just to the SE of F1, going down the slope towards the river, is completely excavated trench F4. The closest trenches to the N are F9 and F13, which are nowhere near as close as F4. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;F1 is a 5m x 5m trench. Actual dimensions of excavation started out at 4m x 4m, although with baulks being cut back the dimensions of the trench for this season ended up being 4.45 m from N to S and 4.10 m from E to W. The trench began the season with an average bottom depth of 568.20 m. At season’s end the trench had reached an average bottom elevation of 567.45. In other words, most of the trench was excavated about 75 cm this season. This season was the continuation of 2 season’s worth of excavation. In the 2000 season excavation on the trench began for the last couple of weeks of the season, while in 2001 the trench was open most of the season. This is my 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;nd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; year running the trench, as I was also trench supervisor in 2001.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Goals for the season were to better establish the time period of the trench. Early results and analysis from last season had led to the belief that a large ashy layer L1037, excavated last season, which capped this season’s artifacts was a possible destruction layer which divided the trench’s 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:super" &gt;rd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Millennium Era with that of the Late Chalcolithic. We also wanted to be able to continue down to the stratigraphic layers that are equal to the large oven in trench F4, since this oven and associated artifacts have been firmly established as Chalcolithic. We were not quite able to match up this trench with the oven of F4 this year, although this is certainly an easily attainable goal for next season, as we don’t believe we are more than 50 cm from being on the same stratigraphic layer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;II- 2002 Excavation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last season’s excavation had left us with the remains of a large black ashy layer that covered the entire trench. The ash was left by an oven which was in the center of the trench. These two loci, 1037 and 1045, had been excavated by the end of last season. Still, as we started out this season we had the remains of the soil from underneath the oven, which we did not believe was part of the oven, as well as a hard packed whitish surface that we postulate is where the black ash came to rest. We had excavated some of this surface last year, but there was still a lot of it left. Last year we had also dug a pit down to an elevation 40 cm below the surface of where we were and had hit the end of the pit with some cobbles. With this knowledge we went to work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We started excavating L1060, a hard baked surface or fill layer which stayed as the same material for about 20 cm. At the same stratigraphic layer we had a hard packed area 1061 in the SE corner which we started as a mini sounding to try to see if the cobbles continued towards the E baulk. These cobbles were L1057. They did not become an active part of the trench until later. We also started the season with the fill from underneath the former oven and the former oven walls. These were loci 1058 and 1059 respectively. These loci ended up merging with other loci, in the case of 1058 it was never excavated as 1058, once the fill around it was level with it we made new loci.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About this time, early in the season, we were having difficulty getting in and out of our trench. We made a step by cutting into the NW until we hit some cobbles, about 70 cm. This was 1062.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the SE corner of the trench we started a very small locus of an ashy layer that ended up lasting only about one cm. This ash lens was 1063. We also had a hard fill layer under this ash lens which was L1064. These were both located in the far SE corner of the trench and were only .77 x .31 meters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the major problems with the trench this year was the lack of identifiable context for a long time in the trench. As one can see we were pretty much going through fill layers at this point hoping that eventually we would come across a good context. We tried our best to understand what was going on in the trench, when in retrospect nothing was making sense because all of what we were digging through was either mudbrick fill or mudbrick slump. Occasionally we would run into things that we hoped were mudbrick walls that would appear to have promise, but in the end we would be left without any greater contexts until we reached the cobble surface L1057 and the areas lower than that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the middle of the trench we ran into an area which we hoped was a pit, although the area wasn’t especially ashy, it was just browner than the light brown dirt we had been excavating. We excavated this locus as 1065. Next to 1065 we found some more fill which was browner than the light brown hard pack 1060. This was a little different, so we excavated it as 1066. In this locus we did find a cool black bead which was F.1.1066.3. Around this area we also ran into a black ashy area which unfortunately only lasted one cm before ending. Underneath 1065 we ran into a hard area we excavated as 1068. All of these loci were all in the E half near the middle of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About this same time we were making new fill loci 1070 and 1071. They were large fill loci that were probably equal to each other that didn’t have very good context. Around this same level we had fill locus 1074. 1074 appeared to be more of a clay locus, but it didn’t look flat or weathered enough to be a surface.  We also excavated another fill locus 1072 which was located in the NE corner of the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Around this stratigraphic layer we found what we believed to be three mudbrick walls in the trench. An examination of these three loci will show some of the problems that we had this year in our excavation. When things are mudbrick walls we are only able to identify them by their change in color, as some mudbrick is a reddish color to contrast with the brown of the trench. On the other hand there are mudbricks which end up the same color as the dirt around it, which makes it very difficult to find, unless there are clear and distinct lines. In 2002 in F1 this was no guarantee of finding a wall, as there may have been many pavements being constructed or laid out with mudbricks in this area. 1069 was a red mudbrick area which we found in the SE corner of the trench which we hoped to be a wall. L1072 was found coming out at an angle from the N baulk and going towards the S baulk. L1076 was another reddish mudbrick area in the SE corner that we thought might connect with L1069. Because of how the excavation proceeded we dealt with 1073 and 1076 first. In the section it looks as though 1073 is only one course high. We realized it was only a pavement and removed it. L1076 was actually laying upon an ashy surface, later to be excavated as L1077 and L1094, so we realized this could not be a wall. After realizing this we looked at 1069 and figured that it was not a wall and was also a pavement. Even looking at the walls of the locus we could not see the wall continuing. So we dug down about 30 cm in excavating this "wall" and we were surprised to see that it was a wall. This wall still continues to this day and appears to be contemporary with the better contexts of this year, which we still have not talked about in this summary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We thought that we were reaching a context when we excavated a pit 1075. This pit area may have actually been a black ashy layer of fill or something like that, or it may have been a pit. We began by only excavating about half of this layer, because we thought this is where it ended. Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall 1069 we were also excavating an ashy layer which comes right up to the wall L1069, a layer that was excavated as two different loci 1077 and 1094. 1094 is the area which was directly underneath 1076, a mudbrick pavement that we left for a while in the trench while we dug down in other areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also around this stratigraphic layer we had a large fill layer which basically was taking up the entire W half of the trench. This was fill locus 1078. This fill was basically a replacement for 1071 because it had been in the trench for awhile. One day we encountered two easily identifiable straight lines in this locus. We thought that we had come up with a wall. It was unfortunately the color of the dirt around it, so we couldn’t see it anywhere except through these two lines. Nevertheless, this "wall" became 1080. Around the same time we had a weird small hard plaster thing next to the S baulk that was 1079. No insight into this weird hard dirt anomaly was ever acquired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since we thought that we had found a new wall we divided the trench and made the area to the S of the wall 1082 and the area to the N 1083. We didn’t use 1081 because it had been taken by the discovery of some interesting slag coming out of the baulk during baulk cleaning and straightening. Once again though, we were looking for things and dividing up loci without any actual knowledge that things were different. We were hoping that we had picked out a wall, but later knowledge would show that this also was probably just mudbrick slump or several mudbricks in a pavement lined up in a row. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Up to this point in this year’s excavation we had tried to peel off a small amount of dirt at a time, trying to be careful. This was not so much because we were in an important context, but more because we were trying to understand what exact type of context we were in. Looking back now I would say that it was a mistake for us to continue digging 5 cm at a time and then cleaning up and looking around for a way to make sense out of all of the hard fill areas which we dug through this year. We probably should have just done what we ended up doing to this stratagraphic layer, which was to bring out the big pick and go down 10 to 15 cm at a time until we hit a good context to work with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We took the big pick out in L1082 to see if the original cobble surface of the year, 1057, would continue underneath this locus. Somewhat disappointingly it continued for only about 20 more cm until it disappeared. While we were big picking in a large fill area in the NE corner of the trench, L1085, we hit into another cobble surface which we began excavating as 1086. This cobble surface ended up being a thin (50 to 70 cm) cobble surface which spanned the entire length of the trench, from the NE corner to the S baulk. From this point on we think that we were actually in some pretty good context. This cobble surface ended up connecting with a cobble surface which was about 10 cm underneath the original cobbles of the season 1057. When we removed 1057 we removed all of the dirt and screened everything. In 1057 we did find another fun little small find, a bone awl or needle, KT 7 of L1057.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had sectioned the "wall" 1080 to see if it continued or if the 1057 continued. It didn’t appear that either one did. This small sectioning was 1088. Fill underneath the cobbles 1057 when it was removed was 1087. Directly underneath this fill was where 1086 went all the way across the trench.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our change to big picking ended with the excavation of these cobbles and what we believe to be a surface that went with these cobbles, 1089. 1089 is actually a tough locus to figure out, because originally we felt as though not only did it go with a cobble surface but it also went with an oven 1090 which we had discovered, along with oven wall 1091. This oven proved to be less exciting than we thought it was going to be, as the black ash area of the oven ended a mere 2 to 3 cm after excavation had started. In addition there were no bricks, just hard baked orange dirt from heat. This oven appears to have been intentionally razed by the inhabitants of the area. As I had indicated, early indications were that this oven went with surface 1089. But in the end we uncovered another surface just underneath 1089 which is 1098. 1098 is a great flat surface with black burned areas on it. Next to this surface we had fill locus 1095 to the south and a new mudbrick wall 1096 to the E. We actually think that 1096 was a wall, but that it was only contemporary with these surfaces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two fill loci next to 1086 which didn’t have much effect were 1099 and 1093. Then we had more cobbles surfaces show up underneath 1086, 1097 in roughly the same place where 1057 had been, a smaller cobble surface, and 1100 a surface which didn’t have quite as many cobbles, so the fill and the cobbles were excavated together. Coming up in 1095 we had many large rocks. We wanted to figure out how these large rocks went together and we went down on this area and ran into some cobbles. It appears that this area 1101 is more of a slump-like area than the other cobbles we have come up with this season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we excavated 1098 we had found a jar rim which appeared to be complete which we theorized was buried in this surface. We were probably correct, as this pottery jar was a complete jar which we were able to excavate on the last day of excavation this season. We had to make a recovery locus 1103 to be able to fully extract. The jar is KT5 of L1103. Lastly, we removed the wall 1096 on the last day of excavation and ran into a new cobble surface with a very large rock on one side near the N baulk and cobbles which were about twice as big as the other cobble surfaces we have had. It went out for about a meter from the N baulk. We named this new locus 1104 and then closed it because we had finished our excavation for the season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have drawn the E baulk so far this year. We added this year’s excavations to last year’s baulk drawing. There is also talk of others drawing another baulk after I have left, but I am not sure which baulk that would be. In the baulk that we drew you can see clearly that there appear to just be different fill loci of differing colors until you reach the wall L1069 which shows up very clearly in section. Below the different fill layers are the cobbles which were part of 1086 and 1100 as well. Other sections tend to show what I have tried to describe, fill with an occasional clear mudbrick in section and occasional easy to spot mudbrick debris. And it shows that evey other mudbrick wall we encountered this year was a pavement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;III- Interpretation and Musings Upon F1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As stated earlier, one of the problems with this trench this year is that we spent a lot of time trying to understand areas that in retrospect appear to be mudbrick fill or slump, or merely fill. We dug down a little at a time, looked for lines, and looked for context where it looks like there was no context. We probably should have taken out the big pick a little earlier to look for a context that we could work with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last context that we had is probably the only example of a good context this year. We have a very good surface and a mudbrick wall which bounds that surface on the E side. In addition, the cobble pathway appears to be somewhat raised from the surface, but a difference of 5 or 10 cm could easily still be part of the same surface. In addition, the cobble 1101 slump fill may be slump from a former wall which would have bounded this surface on the S side. Especially if the original wall fell over towards the south then the large rocks and the cobbles which fell over would have originally been near the buried jar, which would have put the jar in one corner of the area. It is still very difficult to tell whether or not this is a domestic area, although the lack of large amounts of artifacts all season would seem to indicate that it was more probably a work area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early analysis of this trench’s artifacts from this season seem to indicate that we are in the Chalcolithic period. This would make this the third oldest trench on the Tepe, as F4, which is right next to F1, has gone down further and D5 has had the discovery of Ubaid period pottery, which is earlier than the late Chalcolithic of area F. Still, this trench is important because it is one of the first chances that we have to look at the Chalcolithic era. While there were not a great deal of interesting contexts this year, the one context that we did have is interesting to interpret.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;IV – Loose Ends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actually, as we come to a close it appears that a lot of the best context from this season will undoubtedly continue next season. There are still various cobbles laying around, including 1101 the cobble slump with large rocks in it, 1100, fill will cobbles in it and near the E baulk, and new larger cobble surface 1104. This should be very interesting for the next excavator to look at. In addition, L1069, the wall in the SE corner of the trench appears to continue. I did not finish excavating these cobble surfaces completely, or even start in the case of 1101 and 1104. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, it is also important to note the relative proclivity that this trench has to F4. Next year the trench should be at the same elevations as the super oven L4023 from F4. While it does not appear that the oven is large enough to actually be within the trench it should be interesting to see if there are any other signs of work areas near the giant oven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wish whoever takes over this trench next year the best of luck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"/&gt;
   &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
